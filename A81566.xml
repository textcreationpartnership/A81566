            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172030:3"/>
here at the Text, <hi>for thy Names ſake, O Lord,</hi> &amp;c That which I deſign to lay before you from the words, is to open to you, and preſs upon you, the weight, and bleſſedneſs of a pardoned condition, that you may be awakened to it, while the day of mercy laſts, and may indeed be in very good earneſt about it, till, through infinite grace, you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and live and dye in the ſweet and bleſſed peace and comfort of it, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>That which I intend to give out from hence (through the ſpirit of grace aſſiſting) is but as previous and preparatory to the opening of a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſtate, and the New Creature in Chriſt; that (if God will) your conſciences may be brought to a thorough a wakening, a ſpiritual ſight and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, and a ſelf-emptyneſs, which is the good and ſafe way of a Soul to Jeſus Chriſt; which from this Scripture take, in theſe plain Obſervations.</p>
                     <p>Obſ. 1. <hi>That great and weighty concernment that ſhould moſt of all take up the thoughts of the hearts of poor ſinners, is that their ſins may be</hi> pardoned.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The great reaſon of Gods pardoning a ſinner, and the Plea that a poor ſinner hath with God, is, that God will pardon for his own Names ſake.</hi>

                     <p>I ſhall hint ſome Reaſons of the Truth, why it is, that the pardon of ſins doth, or ſhould, ſo greatly take up the hearts of ſinful creatures.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon 1. The pardon of ſin ſhould thus greatly take up the hearts of all that indeed expect pardon, <hi>becauſe 'twas the greateſt thing</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>that ever took up Gods heart, how a ſinner might be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> He laid forth more of his <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> about it, than in the making of the Heavens and the Earth: The framing of the New Covenant, the giving out of his eternal Son Jeſus Chriſt, God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh, ſuch a Glorious way of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling juſtice and mercy through the death of Chriſt, (the choiceſt piece of divine Wiſdom that ever was brought forth) they were all converſant about, and their proper tendency was about this great and weighty concernment, <hi>how,</hi> and that a ſinner <hi>might</hi> be pardoned; when <hi>Moſes</hi> had that bleſſed enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and parley with the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. &amp; 34. and <hi>Moſes</hi> getting nearer and nearer to God, who was glimpſing out a ray of glory upon him, breaks out, <hi>Show me thy glory: I will,</hi> ſaith God, I will ſhew thee what way of Glory I moſt deſign to my ſelf among the Sons of men,—<hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi> And as if this had not been enough (the heart
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172030:4"/>
of the bleſſed God was ſo infinitely taken with it) <hi>Chap.</hi> 34.5, 6. The Lord comes nearer to him, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended in a Cloud, and ſtood with him there;</hi> and as if meerly to have ſpoken what he had before ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Namely, <hi>That he ſhould have mercy,</hi> had not been enough, at <hi>verſe</hi> 6. He <hi>proclaims</hi> it, and makes it as his proper <hi>Name</hi> and moſt glorious <hi>Title, The Lord, the Lord God, Merciful and Gracious,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>forgiving iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. As if <hi>forgiving iniquity</hi> were the great deſign of glory he had upon the world; his heart moſt affected and taken up with it; this is the firſt reaſon; poor ſinners ſhould have their hearts moſt taken up about the pardon of ſins, becauſe the heart of the infinite wiſe and bleſſed God is moſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The pardon of ſin ſhould ſo greatly take up the heart of a poor guilty ſinner, becauſe <hi>Nothing is a Bleſſing to a man till his ſins are pardoned, but All a curſe.</hi> The Scripture is well known that proves it, among many, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.15, 16. <q>If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve to do all his Commandments, and his Statutes which I command thee this day, that all thoſe curſes ſhall come upon thee and overtake thee, Curſed ſhalt thou be in the City, and curſed ſhalt thou be in the field; Curſed ſhall be thy basket and thy Store; Curſed ſhall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy Land, the encreaſe of thy kine, and the flocks of thy ſheep; Curſed ſhalt thou be when thou comeſt in, and curſed ſhalt thou be when thou goeſt out, the Lord ſhall ſend upon thee curſing, vexation, and rebuke in all that thou ſetteſt thine hand for to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> Now that Soul that doth not hearken to the voice of God, according to the tenour of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to come unto Jeſus Chriſt, to have his ſins pardoned, to have the ſpirit given him to walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

God in all his ways, is in an unpardoned condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo liable to all theſe curſes; now, under the old Teſtament God did more uſually come forth in viſible ſtroaks of puniſhment upon outward mercies: But under the New Teſtament, his judgments (eſpecially upon ſuch as are under the Goſpel) are more ſpiritual, (as bleſſings to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple run in a more ſpiritual way) as in curſing them with <hi>hardneſs</hi> and <hi>blindneſs of heart,</hi> having <hi>reſiſted</hi> the truth, but yet though ſuch outward curſes are not ſo viſibly and frequently executed, (though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are) yet unpardoned unconverted ſinners enjoy not their outward good things as a <hi>bleſſing,</hi> but they ſerve but to further their damnation, if their hearts are not (through infinite grace) made <hi>ſoft,</hi> and turn unto the Lord, that they may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Now, to have outward mercies, and be hardened in an impenitent eſtate under them, is a far greater curſe than to have them ſmitten or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered from the Lord, though with the heavieſt hand. This is the 2d. Reaſon of the point: Every thing is a curſe, (while ſuch) to an unpardoned ſinner; therefore 'tis of the greateſt weight to have his heart taken up about it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The perſon of an unpardoned ſinner is hated of the Lord,</hi> therefore the weight of it is very great, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Thou hateſt all workers of iniquity.

drop of whoſe wrath is able to ſcortch the Soul with uſpeakable torment; yet ſuch is the condition of a wretched unpardoned ſinner; therefore 'tis his great concernment to look to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>While a ſinner is unpardoned, he is under the Law.</hi> What that is, I ſhall, if God will, further diſcover; he ſtands bound over to the moſt exact fulfilling of it, under the penalty of Hell, bound to make God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the utmoſt, upon the leaſt breach; and being under tranſgreſſion of it, is under wrath and condemnation, if he abide ſo, without Remedy. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> but <hi>All condemnation</hi> to thoſe that are out of Chriſt Jeſus, as all unpardoned ſinners are; therefore 'tis a condition above all others to be weighed and conſidered, and not to be reſted in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

ſalvation, then God hears his cryes at the very firſt <hi>breathing</hi> of his ſoul, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.56. but not till then doth God regard the multitude of his Prayers, Alms, Worſhip, Keeping conſcience to men; therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if nothing be accepted with God, till in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned condition, ſuch an eſtate requires great and deep thoughts of heart of it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6.

                     <p n="4">4. Let <hi>pardoned ones,</hi> whom it doth coſt much, as to means to get it made good to you, make much of your comfort, and do not Triſſe it, nor ſin it away; and keep the ſenſe of a pardoned condition <hi>warm</hi>

So bleſſed <hi>Paul, Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, whereof I am the chief; that ſin by the commandment might become exceeding ſinful,</hi> Rom. 7.13.

                        <p>In the opening of this Point, firſt I would ſhew, <hi>Why,</hi> ſuch as come in a right way for pardon, do look upon their ſins as <hi>great</hi> ſins.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. How they come to ſee them ſo.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="19" facs="tcp:172030:11"/>2. <hi>When</hi> a ſinner may be ſaid to have ſeen his ſins ſo great as a pardoned ſoul ſhould do.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Sinners that come to God for pardon and find it, do look upon their ſins as <hi>great</hi> ſins, <hi>becauſe againſt a great God, great</hi> in power, <hi>great</hi> in juſtice, <hi>great</hi> in holineſs; I am a worm, and yet ſin, and that boldly, againſt a God ſo <hi>great;</hi> for a worm to lift up himſelf againſt a great and infinite God; Oh this makes every little ſin <hi>great,</hi> and calls for <hi>great</hi> venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from ſo great a God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Becauſe they have ſinned againſt great patience,</hi> deſpiſing the goodneſs, forbearance, and long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of God, which is call'd <hi>treaſuring up of wrath, Rom.</hi> 2.4, 5. Oh, ſaith a poor abaſed ſinner at Gods feet, How have I wearied the patience of God! <hi>I have not wearied thee,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>but thou haſt been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of me, and haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, and wearied me with thine iniquities,</hi> Iſa. 43.23, 24. Oh, this is an <hi>humbling</hi> and heart-breaking word to a poor ſoul before the Lord; this makes his ſin appear <hi>great</hi> indeed. I have wearied the bleſſed God with my ſin, and yet he calls upon me that he may pardon me, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. of the ſame Chapter. This greatens ſin to purpoſe, to a poor ſoul that hath abuſed much patience.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Sins do appear great, becauſe againſt great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> Oh, againſt how many mercies and kindneſſes do ſinners ſin againſt, and turn all the mercies of God into ſin! Oh, ſaith a poor ſoul, drawing near to God, I turned all the mercies of the Lord againſt him, took his mercies and fought againſt him with them, and ſerved the Devil and my luſts with them; if God will come and account with me for them, how ſhall I anſwer him?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That which <hi>greatens</hi> ſin in the eyes of poor
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:172030:12"/>
ſinners that cry for pardon, is, <hi>that they have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt great light,</hi> light in the Conſcience; this heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens ſin exceedingly, eſpecially to ſuch as are under Goſpel-means, and is indeed the ſin of all in this Nation; there's nothing more abaſeth a ſoul than this, nothing makes it more difficult to believe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, when humbled for it; therefore 'tis, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor ſouls fear that they have ſinn'd the unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they have ſinned againſt knowledge and light, which though while they are humbled before the Lord, it cannot be that they have ſo ſinned <hi>unpardonably;</hi> yet in as much as 'tis the ſin that borders next upon the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, it much <hi>greatens</hi> ſin to a poor ſoul under the ſenſe of it. Such a ſinner is ſaid to <hi>reproach the Lord,</hi> Numb. 15.30, 31. <hi>Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin; James</hi> 4. laſt. To him it is <hi>ſin,</hi> that is <hi>great ſin,</hi> of which God will take the ſevereſt account: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as have the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and the knowledge of the Word in ſome meaſure, and yet go on impenitently in ſin, they are the greateſt ſinners in the world, and will have the greateſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and this circumſtance in ſin makes, or ſhould do ſo, ſuch ſouls that never lived in notorious ſins, be under deep abaſement, becauſe, though their Sins were not ſo groſs as many others, yet they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>great light</hi> and knowledge, which makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>little</hi> ſin continued in <hi>great</hi> in the account of God, and great in the account of the ſinner, when he comes before the Lord in the ſenſe of it. Oh, I pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf in ſins that I <hi>knew</hi> to be ſins, and was convinced by the Word of God of them, yet I went on, and loved them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Continuance in ſin, much greatens ſin to a poor ſoul,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:172030:12"/>
that is, after pardon;</hi> eſpecially ſuch as are not very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted. <hi>God will wound the hairy ſcalp of ſuch a one that goeth on ſtill in his treſpaſſes,</hi> Pſal. 68.21. Oh, I added ſin unto ſin, ſaith a poor ſoul, ſpending the choice time of my youth in ſin, when I might have been getting the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and honouring of God. This lay cloſe upon <hi>David's</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as appears in this 25th. Pſal. 7. <hi>Oh remember not the ſins of youth,</hi> &amp;c. Yet we do not find that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> youth was notoriouſly ſinful; but in as much as he ſpent not his youth to get knowledge, and to ſerve the Lord fully, 'twas his burden and complaint before the Lord; much more ſuch whoſe youth was ſpent in nothing but vanity, prophaneneſs, lying, ſwearing, prophaning of the Sabbath, ſports, paſt-times, exceſs of riot, and the like, when God lays it in upon their Conſciences, muſt be greivous and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to their ſouls.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Multitudes of ſins do make ſin appear great,</hi> this made <hi>David</hi> cry out for <hi>multitude of mercies,</hi> Pſal. 51. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Innumerable evils have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about, mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, ſo that I am not able to look; they are more than the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> One ſin, but a ſinful thought, is worthy of a thouſand Hells, much more, multiplyed, numberleſs, infinite ſins, in thought, words, walkings, calling, worſhip, in all I have done, I did nothing elſe but ſin: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leaſt ſinner in the world is a great ſinner, when God lays his <hi>account</hi> before him.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Another thing that <hi>greatens</hi> ſin is, <hi>that it was againſt purpoſes and reſolutions of forſaking ſuch and ſuch ſins;</hi> and yet all broken, ſometimes againſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vows, againſt prayers: This conſideration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many a poor ſoul ſticks hard, and lays low, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:172030:13"/>
makes his ſin grievous indeed, that againſt purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, vows, prayers, he ſhould return to his ſin; this makes him cry out, Oh my ſin is <hi>great, great</hi> indeed; Doth, will the Lord pardon ſuch a Wretch? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. Sin appears <hi>great,</hi> when ſeen by a poor ſoul, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was reigning ſin,</hi> Rom. 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Sin reigned to death, &amp;c.</hi> Oh, ſaith a poor humbled ſinner, I did not only <hi>commit</hi> ſin, but I was the <hi>ſervant</hi> and <hi>ſlave</hi> of ſin, I obey'd ſin as a Lord, and that <hi>willingly,</hi> I obey'd it in the luſts thereof; where God, Chriſt, his Spirit, Word, Law, ſhould have dwelt and reigned, there ſin and luſts bore ſway, and had the command of my ſoul. A little ſin when a <hi>reigning</hi> ſin, is a great ſin. All that ſin can do, is but to rule the ſinner, and ſo it doth the leaſt ſinner that is under it, though it break not forth into groſs notorious actings againſt the Lord, and this doth much greaten it.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>Sin in the fountain makes it great:</hi> As it may be ſaid, there is more water in the fountain, than in the pools and ſtreams it makes; becauſe there is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual iſſuing and flowing out of it, which is able to make far greater ſtreams: So in the nature, in the heart, is there as in the <hi>fountain,</hi> and therefore 'tis more there than in the breakings forth of it in the outward man; ſo that, though a ſinner in his youth hath been reſtrained from many great ſins, yet in as much as ſin in the fountain was as full as in any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the world, though reſtrained and pent in (which the ſinner was not beholding to his own heart for) it renders him a <hi>great</hi> ſinner before the Lord, when ſavingly enlightned. The want of this conſideration makes outwardly righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not look upon themſelves as great ſinners; they ſee and feel not ſin infinite in the fountain of it, which moſtly greatens it, above all the actings of it in this life.</p>
                        <p n="10">
                           <pb n="23" facs="tcp:172030:13"/>10. A ſinner drawing nigh to God for pardon, ſees his ſin as <hi>great, becauſe thereby he was led captive by the Devil at his will: He that committeth ſin is of the Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. <hi>committeth</hi> ſin, ſo as in a ſtate of ſin, under the power of ſin, and not born of God, why ſuch a one <hi>is of the Devil,</hi> under the power of the Devil, of the Devil and not of God; and this becauſe of ſin, which gives this dominion to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Oh, ſaith a poor Creature, I that was the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and ſhould have lived to him, lived to the Devil, and the ſervice of him; and took part with him, againſt Chriſt, his Word, his Saints, and was an enemy to them: This greatens my ſin before the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Sin appears <hi>great, becauſe great is the wrath of God againſt ſin;</hi> ſinners are ſaid <hi>to heap up wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. and they are called the <hi>Children of wrath.</hi> God to manifeſt his diſpleaſure againſt ſin, pours out ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wrath upon an unpardoned ſinner, to leave the ſinner under endleſs torment of ſoul and body. God hates nothing but ſin, and for ſin, and ſo hates it, that infinite endleſs wrath muſt be the vengeance of it. Oh, when God gives a ſinner a glimpſe of this! Oh the greatneſs of every little ſin to deſerve ſuch wrath! How ſhall I flee from and eſcape the wrath to come? who can ſtand before ſuch wrath, who can bear it?</p>
                        <p n="12">12. The way of any ſinner's deliverance from ſuch wrath, ſhews ſin to be exceeding <hi>great, in the price and ranſom that is paid for the ſalvation of him from his ſins,</hi> the price of the blood of the eternal Son of God. How great was ſin, how ſinful and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable the nature of it in the eye of the righteous God, when juſtice could not be ſatisfied but by ſuch a way? Oh, ſaith a poor ſoul that comes for pardon,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:172030:14"/>
what a damnable thing is ſin, which was once no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me, that redemption from it is at ſuch a rate! God had no greater a price to give, than what he laid down to ſave a wretched ſinner from his ſin. Oh, 'twas great ſin that muſt crucifie the Lord of life and glory, therefore doth my ſoul hate it.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Laſtly, This conſideration alſo <hi>greatens</hi> ſin, in as much as a poor creature hath drawn and tempted others to ſin with him, eſpecially ſuch as have lived more vainly and looſly, and it lies hard upon many a poor ſoul after thorough conviction. Oh, how many have I drawn to ſin, not only by my example, but encouragement and perſwaſion, that may be now in Hell for ſuch ſins, or are under a ſtate of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and hardened by me. Oh, this is an abaſing conſideration to a poor, convinced, humbled ſinner, when God ſmites his heart with it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Before we go further, let us labour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to the conſciences of all. I have ſhewed you, the matter we are upon is the weightieſt that ever took up God's heart, the pardoning of a ſinner; and therefore, how ſhould it ſwallow up the hearts of poor undone ſouls, that are ſo infinitely concern'd in it. I beſeech you therefore, lay to your hearts what hath been ſpoken as to the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of ſin; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, If ſouls that come to God by Chriſt for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſee their ſins as <hi>great</hi> ſins, and 'tis their great trouble they cannot ſee them greater;</p>
                        <p>Firſt then, This may ſerve to take off that woful deceit of heart, and deluſion of the Devil, of poor careleſs ſouls that dream of pardon, and yet never in any meaſure thus ſaw their ſins as great; this ſhews the heart was never touched of God, never ſmitten for ſin as yet; this is the way indeed of unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:172030:14"/>
ſinners, they are <hi>leſſening</hi> their ſins to God and themſelves, finding out circumſtances to <hi>leſſen</hi> them, of others tempting them, and the Devil, and the like; and many or moſt of Men or Women allow themſelves in the ſame, or they were overtaken, or the like; they think they can eaſily pacifie God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and that God makes not ſo great a matter of it; thus a deceitful heart and a cheating Devil juggle together, and ſooth Conſcience in a damnable peace: And ſuch ſouls call their great reigning ſins their <hi>infirmity,</hi> and God will not be ſo exact as ſome of the Preachers make him; here's a ſinner rivetted in a curſed eſtate. But now take a Soul whom God (as I ſhall ſhew) hath made ſenſible of ſin, and the weight of pardon, and comes to the feet of the Lord for it, 'tis quite otherwiſe. Oh, my ſins, Wretch that I was and am, were little ſins to me before, but now they are great ſins; I called it my <hi>infirmity</hi> to lye, ſwear, prophane the Sabbath, allow my ſelf in any exceſs; but now I ſee 'twas reigning ſin, ſoul-damning ſin, great, oh great ſin; Oh that I am out of Hell! Oh the patience of God! Is there mercy for ſuch a wretch? What a wonder will it be if I get to Heaven? How great will that mercy be that pardons me?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Therefore in the ſecond place, <hi>Examine how it is with you?</hi> and whether you have had ſome ſuch workings of heart; Have you been before the Lord in <hi>David</hi>'s poſture, Oh, <hi>mine iniquity is great!</hi> Oh, I I have ſinned againſt a great God, wearied great pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, turned great mercies into ſin. Oh I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt great light, How ſhall I be pardoned? Sins continued in, and multiplied from my youth up, and theſe againſt ſerious purpoſes, under the reign of it; there's an infinite fountain of all evil
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:172030:15"/>
within me. If I have been any way reſtrained, no thanks to my own heart for it. Oh, ſaith a poor ſoul, I was led by the Devil, befool'd by the Devil, ſerved the Devil againſt God; and now, what can I challenge at the Hands of God? What belongs to me but wrath, great wrath, everlaſting wrath, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wrath? If one ſin deſerves a thouſand Hells, what do innumerable tranſgreſſions do? If Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be not infinite, How ſhall I look up to God, or how ſhall God look down upon me? Oh, I ſay, let your Conſcience anſwer, hath it been thus, in ſome good and <hi>real</hi> meaſure, though not ſo <hi>deep</hi> as your ſoul deſires. I know there are degrees, and I alſo know till God come to let out himſelf in ſuch a way as ☞ this, that ſin is <hi>great,</hi> and greater in mine eye then ever, we make but ſlight work of it in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; want of this makes many in theſe days run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with pleaſant notions of Grace, Chriſt, Light, (though bleſſed be the Lord for ever, for the more glorious Revelation of all theſe, but I ſpeak of abuſes) but <hi>ſin</hi> was never <hi>great</hi> by the appearance of God, and ſo they wanton with ſuch <hi>Notions</hi> which at laſt wear off, and ſo they come to nothing but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the Goſpel.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In the third place, therefore, let it ſerve to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort</hi> ſinners to look back upon your lives, even from your youth up: You may find one more of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries mentioned of the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of ſin, that you will fall under; eſpecially ſuch as have been given to the prophaneſs and vanities of the age you live in, lying, ſwearing, prophaning of the Sabbath, to riot, ungodly paſtimes and ſports, reviling the Godly, or other more ſecret wickedneſſes and pollutions; any of which may beſpeak thee in a ſtate of ſin and wrath, joyned with thy living in the neglect of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:172030:15"/>
known duties, upon which neglect God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a <hi>curſe,</hi> as the neglect of ſecret or Family-prayer, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Or if thou haſt not been engaged in groſs ſins, but haſt been ſober and well carriaged from thy youth up, yet thou mayſt be ſtill in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of ſin, but go a little more ſoberly to Hell, and in more danger of being damned in thy civil ſober carriage than great ſinners, with which thou art apt to compare thy ſelf, and ſeeing thy ſelf not ſo bad as them, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all is well; but remember well what hath been proved, that ſin is greater in the Fountain than the ſtreams, though it make a greater noiſe or ſhew to others in the ſtream of ones life; thou haſt a Hell in thy nature, an infinite fountain of any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ever any of the Sons or Daughters of men did commit, an Idolater, an Adulterer, a Murderer, a Sodomite, a Devil in thy Heart and whole frame of thy Nature. In a word, one ſin, which thou calleſt little, reigning but in thy heart, and cheriſhed there, is enough to ſend thee to Hell, as if thou wert the verieſt Reprobate living. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> that thought himſelf a blameleſs man, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.6. afterwards cries out of <hi>exceeding ſinfulneſs, Rom.</hi> 7.13. yea, the greateſt, the <hi>chief of ſinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. But I hope to meet with thee, and with thy conſcience, as to this conviction, more hereafter.</p>
                        <p>The next inquiry will be, <hi>when</hi> a poor ſoul may be ſaid to be under ſuch a diſcovery of the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of ſin, as may lead him to get pardon through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. One diſcovery I have named already; which is, <hi>ſuch a ſoul doth not go about to leſſen his ſin, but greeaten it to his greater abaſement;</hi> 'tis his fear he doth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:172030:16"/>
not ſee his ſins <hi>great</hi> enough, to lay him low enough before the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When ſuch a ſight and diſcovery of ſin, <hi>it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets trouble upon the ſpirit:</hi> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. you have <hi>David</hi> under a great diſcovery of ſin, and he cries out, <hi>there is no reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin; I am troubled, I am bowed down, I go mourning all the day;</hi> ſuch a trouble, that will not admit of peace and healing, but from Jeſus Chriſt, till it can take hold of Jeſus Chriſt in a promiſe of Grace and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and come to him, and cloſe with him to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and Sanctified by him and in him; as I am at large to ſhew, if God will. I ſpeak this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a trouble for ſin, that often ends in a more dangerous peace: Many poor creatures have for a time been troubled for ſin, and they have made one ſhift or other to quiet themſelves, it may be leave their ſins, and do a little ſomething more, but never come in a Goſpel-way to Chriſt; which I am alſo (through grace) to evidence in the diſcovery of a falſe Converſion. However, ſo it is, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoul that is unbottomed from a falſe peace, a peace in ſin, or reſting in his duties, he comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der trouble, more or leſs, in and for his ſin, as he gets to pardon.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>God ſmites a ſoul for ſome ſpecial particular ſin;</hi> Jer. 3.13. <hi>Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God, and haſt ſcattered thy ways under every green tree,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>General</hi> acknowledgment of Sins comes to nothing, 'tis the note of a Hypocrite; but <hi>particular</hi> Sins lying upon the ſoul, ſpeak forth ſpiritual convictions, when joyned, I mean with other workings of heart we are now ſetting forth. So Chriſt dealt with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria, Joh.</hi> 4.16.29. Found her at,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:172030:16"/>
and ſmote her in her particular Sin.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. As God ſmites, <hi>ſo the ſinner is in particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion before the Lord,</hi> loads his heart with Sin, till it breaks.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But who will not <hi>confeſs</hi> himſelf a Sinner, you will ſay?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truly few, in a Scripture ſaving ſenſe. A word or two more to this; That <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin before the Lord, is a duty, and ſuch as hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of forgiveneſs of Sin, ſuch places of Scripture will clear, Pſal. 32. <hi>I acknowledge my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; I ſaid I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my ſin;</hi> Prov. 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall find mercy; If we confeſs our ſins he is faithful and juſt, to forgive us our ſins,</hi> 1 John 1.9. This being a duty to which ſo bleſſed promiſes are annexed, 'tis of much concernment to ſouls that are very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious about <hi>forgiveneſs,</hi> to have it ſtated aright, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture and ſaving Experience.</p>
                        <p>There is a <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin, that doth not entitle to the promiſe, which a <hi>hypocrite</hi> may reach to; ſo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 9.27. <hi>I have ſinned this time, the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked;</hi> here's confeſſion, but no pardon; ſo <hi>Judas,</hi> Matth. 27.3, 4. <hi>I have ſinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood;</hi> ſo <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.29. <hi>I have ſinned, for I have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Commandment of the Lord;</hi> Here are ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal inforced confeſſions, when the hand of God was upon them, and yet did not end in mercy.</p>
                        <p>The confeſſion of a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> proceeds only from judgment felt or feared; but that which is <hi>ſincere</hi> and ends in mercy and pardon, goes upon better grounds.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="30" facs="tcp:172030:17"/>1. As firſt, <hi>Confeſſion that hath the promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, is accompanied with hatred of ſin.</hi> So in that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed draught of the New Covenant Ezek. 36. <hi>I will ſave you from your uncleanneſſes,</hi> &amp;c. verſe 29. and verſe 31. <hi>Then ſhall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities, and for you abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Then,</hi> when God comes in a way of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and pardon, then God will make them <hi>remember</hi> their wickedneſſes, that they had even forgotten, and had thought that God had forgotten them alſo: They thought they were <hi>good</hi> ways before, but now the Lord ſhews them they were <hi>not good,</hi> and they <hi>loath</hi> themſelves: Sin is not only a <hi>terror,</hi> but a <hi>loathſom</hi> thing to them, <hi>hateful</hi> to the ſoul that is under this conviction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whence, <hi>ſecondly, Saving confeſſion reſpects the pollution of ſin. They ſhall loath themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That thou mayeſt remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified toward thee;</hi> In that 38th. <hi>Pſal. David</hi> is in ſelf-loathing; this doth ariſe (as preſently I ſhall ſhew) from a glimpſe of Gods holineſs, which I humbly conceive, no reprobate in the World doth reach to, to loath ſin, becauſe it makes him an unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Creature.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It follows therefore that ſuch <hi>confeſſion follows ſin to the root, to the fountain,</hi> there ſees it moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, odious, infinite. So <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. A Hypocrites confeſſion ends in outward groſs ſins, from terror only, and reacheth not to heart-ſin, pollution of nature; and if he can reach to reform ſuch outward groſs ſins, he hath done, as he thinks, the utmoſt, but never comes to loath (and ſo to mortifie, through the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:172030:17"/>
ſpirit) ſin at the root: But ſincere ſouls, touched by the Holy Ghoſt, with a ſaving ſenſe of ſin, do drive ſin home to its original, to its root, in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal corruption of heart and nature, and there the ſevereſt edge and indignation againſt it is let forth.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Brokenneſs of heart for ſin, is an effect of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> Pſal. 51.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 57.15. And this ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth upon ſenſe of Gods patience, goodneſs, love; as hatred of the pollution of ſin, ariſeth from a ſight of Gods Holineſs; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> crys out, he had ſinned, when he ſmarted with puniſhment, but was ſtill under the plague of his hard heart, <hi>Ex.</hi> 9.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34. There is indeed a kind of brokenneſs, that the hammerings of terrour, by puniſhments, or by the Word, may work, which may a little wear and rough-hew the heart, and yet go no further, but yet leave the heart under its natural <hi>hardneſs,</hi> but now that which is the Spirits ſaving work kindly melts the heart, makes it ſoft, and ſo it can <hi>pour</hi> out it ſelf to God in heart-melting confeſſions; at leaſt, the poor ſoul mourns over the hardneſs of its heart, oh that I have thus ſinned, and yet my heart will not break? bleſſed be every ſtroak, and every word of God, and every Ordinance, that through grace breaks my heart more. A ſincere ſoul ſets a high price upon <hi>brokenneſs,</hi> and yet reſts not in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Such confeſſion that hath the promiſe, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſoul abaſement; He that humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhall be exalted,</hi> Luke 18.14. ſpoken upon the Publicans acceptance with God in his Confeſſion, <hi>ſmiting upon his breaſt,</hi> in a deep abaſement, <hi>not lifting up his eyes to Heaven:</hi> So that great promiſe, 2 Chron. 7.14. <hi>If my people ſhall humble themſelves, and pray, and

ſeek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from Heaven, and will forgive their ſins:</hi> This is a work of the narroweſt ſearch of any other. I intend, if the Lord will, to ſpeak to this more diſtinctly and fully, only now a word of Humiliation, as is joyned with ſuch confeſſion, that hath the promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which is the ſcope we drive at.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When the Soul is in confeſſion, and under the Lords <hi>humblings</hi> in order to pardon, <hi>The poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acknowledgeth himſelf infinitely unworthy that ever the Lord ſhould caſt a look upon him, or give out mercy and pardon to him:</hi> This Concluſion is fixed upon the ſoul, and the Soul falls down abaſed in the ſenſe of it, whatever the Lord do with me, I will lay my mouth in the duſt, I am worthy of <hi>nothing</hi> from the Lord, but a thouſand Hells; this <hi>quiets the heart</hi> in ſome meaſure, whatever the pleaſure of the Lord be towards him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As the poor ſinful Creature is worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>ſo he will give glory to God, if God never pardon;</hi> God is never the leſs righteous or holy, if he never let out one drop of mercy upon ſo vile a Creature: <hi>Thou art holy,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22.3. <hi>But I am a worm, and no man,</hi> verſe 6. A worm, fit for God and man to tread upon, and yet muſt not riſe up againſt God, nor ſay to him, what doeſt thou? <hi>No Man:</hi> I have unman'd my ſelf with ſin, I am duſt and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it ſelf, <hi>vile</hi> duſt; that's my make, my frame: Oh, I muſt give glory to his juſtice, though I periſh for ever.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>The poor Creature hath no good, no, not the leaſt, to procure pardon, or to move God to pardon,</hi> Pſal. 14.3. Saith a poor humbled ſoul, treating for pardon, if mercy and pardon muſt come forth upon terms of my good, having or doing any thing, but what hath
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:172030:18"/>
infinitely Sin enough in it to damn me for ever; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly to Hell I muſt: No, Sin enough to ſend a world of ſouls to Hell, but not a drop of good to move the Lord to mercy. If God give out mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon a Sight of good, I expect not a drop from him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It follows from hence, when a ſinner comes humbled, <hi>he comes as nothing elſe but a ſinner:</hi> Luke 18.13. <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner:</hi> One, that's <hi>nothing elſe</hi> but a wretched Sinner, for ſo the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can means it, as in a contrary frame to the Phariſee, who thanks God <hi>that he was not ſo bad as many were,</hi> though the Phariſee no doubt would acknowledge ſome Sin, but now the Publican is <hi>All a ſinner,</hi> in as bad a condition as any Sinner in the World: Poor Souls in theſe days, they hope they have not ſo much need of Chriſt as many great ſinners, they be not <hi>nothing elſe</hi> but Sinners, they have or do ſome good: The diſcuſſion of this will be the next diſcourſe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now a word more: Know Sinner, that one Sin ſtrikes off all thy pretended good, as ſhall at large through mercy be proved to thee: Stick to one drop of good in thee or from thee, when thou comeſt for mercy and pardon, and thou loſeſt all: Oh, to be <hi>wholly</hi> condemned, <hi>wholly</hi> unrighteous, <hi>wholly</hi> a ſinner, is a great work; 'tis the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing conviction of any other. While a man hath any thing to live upon, he is not fit to beg; ſo while a ſoul hath a drop of any thing, that in his own ſenſe, may the more admit him to pardon, he cannot have it. Take it thus, If one come to your doors and beg, and he hath good Cloaths on his Back, and he ſhould ſay, I have good Cloaths on my back, I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my own, therefore I pray give me: Would you not anſwer, if you have ſomething of your own,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:172030:19"/>
and are pretty well cloathed, why ſhould you beg; 'tis not for you come and ask alms? But if a poor naked wretch come, and ſay, and cry, Oh, I am a poor Creature, a poor naked deſtitute creature, I have nothing, all's gone, I have loſt all, pray cover me, pray feed me; out of great pity you will look upon ſuch a poor Wretch, and do ſomething for him, if you have any bowels: So, if a Sinner (as that Phariſee did) come and ſay, Lord I have done this and this, I have not been ſo wicked as many, I do ſome good, therefore pardon, that <hi>therefore</hi> will make the Lord ſend thee away without mercy: No, ſaith God, live upon what thou haſt, if thou haſt any thing: Oh Sinner, thou art not fit to beg, (to beg mercy and pardon) till thou haſt juſt nothing of thy own, which the natural pride of thy heart will very hardly come off to.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In the way of Mens Tribunals of Juſtice, and Courts of Life and Death: If a Malefactor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law, and he yet plead, Though I am proved a Thief or a Murderer, yet I have kept the reſt of the Law, I have broken no Law of the Nation that deſerves death beſide, ſhall not this rather juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, than this crime condemn me; No, ſaith the Judge, That's nothing to us, though thou haſt kept the Law in other things, thou muſt dye by the Law, as a Tranſgreſſor of it, for this thou haſt done: Why then, ſaith the condemned perſon, I muſt plead all mercy. Juſt ſo it is at the Tribunal of God, comes a poor Soul that is convinced he hath ſinn'd, Oh, but ſaith he in his heart, I have kept the Law in many or moſt things, will not that commend me to God? Will not God look upon my good more than my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? No, ſaith God in his word, thou haſt broken the Law, and thou art curſed, therefore the Law can
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:172030:19"/>
ſhew thee no mercy. I can take no notice of any of thy pretended keeping of it in any other thing; Oh, then muſt a poor Sinner ſay, then it muſt be all, all of mercy, if I am ever pardoned; this may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſcover ſuch a <hi>humiliation</hi> that follows confeſſion that hath the promiſe of pardon.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. One thing more, which I ſhall but mention; ſuch a <hi>confeſſion</hi> of ſin as hath the promiſe of <hi>mercy,</hi> is accompanied with a firm reſolution, through grace, to <hi>forſake</hi> Sin, every Sin, in heart and life; <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins, ſhall find mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. <hi>as before.</hi> Mark well that famous promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon:</hi> Here's forſaking ways and thoughts; Sins of Heart and Life, and not a forſaking or leaving of ſome great Sins, but forſaking and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt a ſinful diſpoſition, ſinful thoughts; and not only a meer leaving of ſin, but a <hi>returning</hi> to the Lord, which he cannot do, if held under the love of but one Sin; and a turning to God only upon the account of free mercy, and then God <hi>abundantly</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons: A good word ſuited to a poor ſoul, under the ſenſe of ſinning <hi>abundantly,</hi> therefore need of <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> of mercy and pardon.</p>

in as <hi>peculiar</hi> a confeſſion as you could, <hi>hating, loathing,</hi> Sin and your ſelves in it? Oh, have you driven Sin to the root, the fountain! Oh, there's a Hell of it within? Say, do you know what it is to gave broken hearts under the weight of Sin, and the ſenſe of the Patience, Grace and Love of God, held forth to you in Jeſus Chriſt? Do you know what <hi>ſoul-abaſement</hi> is, acknowledging in confuſion of face, that you are worthy of nothing from the Lord for ever? not ſo much as a glimpſe of mercy, a good look from him, becauſe you have ſo ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? Have you glorified God, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pardon you? and is he holy and bleſſed, though you are baniſhed from him for ever? Have you been ſo reduced to ſee that there's not the leaſt attom of good to commend you to the Lord, and ſo lain down as <hi>nothing elſe</hi> but a Sinner before him; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Sins to damn thee, but not a drop of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to cover thee; and ſo creep to the ſeat of mercy, infinite, free mercy? yea, haſt thou ſeen and felt the difficulty of ſuch a <hi>ſelf-emptineſs,</hi> that thou wouldſt rather part with all thy Sin than thy ſelf-righteouſneſs: ☞ A poor ſoul would take up from Sin, upon conviction of the damnableneſs of it, and be more righteous and holy, but to be reduced firſt to nothing, nothing elſe but a poor, vile, unrighteous, weak, empty creature, and ſo to Chriſt; here the pride of heart ſticks.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:172030:20"/>
Many poor ſinful Creatures reſolve they will never hearken to ſuch a word as ſhall <hi>trouble</hi> them, and cannot bear ſuch preaching as would <hi>trouble</hi> their Conſciences: One word with you, Why ſoul, Haſt thou been diſhonouring God, abuſing his patience and mercy, tranſgreſſing his Holy Commands, ſlighting his Grace, and yet thou muſt not be <hi>troubled</hi> for it? Wilt thou have thouſands of Sins upon thy Soul unpardoned, and tread upon the brink of Hell every ſtep thou goeſt, and not be <hi>troubled</hi> about it? It ſeems then thou reſolveſt not to trouble thy ſelf much about that petty buſineſs (as thou makeſt it) of being damned for ever, or ſaved for ever? No, nothing about Sin, Guilt, Pardon, Heaven and Hell, muſt trouble thee? Alas, poor deluded creature, what care it there to get to Hell peaceably; for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any one got to Heaven ſo, that was never <hi>troubled</hi> about getting his Sins pardoned: Away, away with ſuch a curſed peace, and let it now trouble thee that thou haſt put off this work ſo long, that Sin and thy Soul have been at ſuch a peace ſo long. Be now at a profeſſed war againſt it, and take part with the Lord and his word, that it teaching thee how yet to arive at the bleſſed Haven of Peace, not with Sin, but with the bleſſed God, againſt whom thou haſt ſo greatly Sinned; Oh look unto him to ſmite a hard ſecure heart, to ſtrike a Boſome Helliſh Luſt, for whoſe peace thou haſt ſo long, and ſo fooliſhly contended; yea, go in ſecret, and fall down before the great God, parcitularly confeſſing and ſhaming thy ſelf, hating, loathing, humbling, till thou cry out, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> here, Oh pardon; what a great matter 'tis for any poor ſoul to be pardoned? Now, great mercy for a great Sinner, or I am loſt for ever. Out-ſinned pardon thou haſt not, if thou comeſt in this poſture to God for it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:172030:21"/>But you may further enquire, how doth God bring a poor Soul to this paſs, to ſuch a deep ſenſe of Sin, ſuch a fight of himſelf, ſo as to be thus before the Lord in ſelf loathing and abaſement. Only now a Word; (1.) When a Soul is brought to this paſs, God lets out an <hi>appearance</hi> of himſelf in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, upon a poor creature, ſuch a glimpſe of light and purity, that makes the creature fall down, and cry out, Oh I am vile, vile as the duſt I tread on? (2.) God gives out the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the word, which <hi>convinceth</hi> and ſearchech the ſoul, ſhews its conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtate, ſin, the damnableneſs and pollution of it, the greatneſs of it, as was ſhewed: The ſpirit opens the <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>ſpirituallity</hi> of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. and ſhews the Sinner, as in a glaſs, what he is: The ſpirit gives a Sight of Jeſus Chriſt pierced with the Sins of ſuch as come unto him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Theſe do cauſe loathing and bitterneſs upon the Soul of a poor Sinner, drawing near to the Lord for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                        <p>Therefore 'tis great wiſdom to be where God ſpeaks, where God appears, where God gives out his ſpirit, which is uſually in the word preached power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and ſetting thy ſelf in ſecret to muſe and ponder about an eternal condition; or when the afflicting Hand of God is upon thee, do not ſay, I am <hi>not ſo great</hi> a Sinner as to make ſo much ado about Pardon or Heaven, if that be thy temper, thou art the moſt likely to be in the road-way to Hell, in peace that will end in woes and ſorrows, of any Soul in the world. Oh, wait for Gods appearance, and every little Sin will be great, a Hell of Sin within thee, though outwardly civil and ſober; wait for the Spirit in the Word, and go and pray for it. 'Tis one thing to know Sin by the Letter of the Law,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:172030:21"/>
which commands this, and forbids that, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to know, ſee, feel Sin, and the infinite evil of it, the exceeding Sinfulneſs and Pollution of it, by the conviction of the Spirit; ſo as to ſee it moſt in the fountain, in thy nature, and there loath and bewail it, becauſe it makes thee unclean and unholy, and unlike God, and unfit for God, or holy communion with him: Which is the way and moſt certain evidence of the Spirits ſaving convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin, (as diſtinguiſhing from that which a hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite may have) and carries a ſoul to the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain opened, Zach.</hi> 13.1. that its iniquity may be throughly <hi>cleanſed.</hi>

If Sinners that come to God for mercy and pardon, ſee their Sin as <hi>great,</hi> then it will follow, that <hi>great</hi> Sinners may be pardoned and ſaved: You that are great Sinners, old Sinners, Oh hearken to this, you that are yet within the reach of Grace, and Mercy, and Pardon, if you will come to Jeſus Chriſt for it, the greatneſs of your Sin is no bar to you, but, if you fail of pardon, 'tis becauſe you will not come to Chriſt for it, and accept it upon Goſpel-terms; you will not have pardon with a <hi>new heart</hi> and <hi>new life,</hi> or you make a ſlight matter of pardon, or you think 'twill come of courſe; or you are afraid to enter into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious review and debate with your ſelves, becauſe your Sins are ſo <hi>great,</hi> they will terrifie you, or take you off your pleaſure and peace of your minds, and joy in the world: Away, away with any of theſe pleas; though thou haſt ſinned much, greatly, long, with all thy might, come to Jeſus Chriſt, and thoſe great Sins are no more before his blood to waſh them away than the leaſt Sin (if any be little) that ever was committed and pardoned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18.

Do not hence ſay ſecurely, Oh 'tis well, that great Sinners may be pardoned, I ever thought ſo, what need ſo much ado? Do not thus harden thy ſelf, and make ſuch a curſed uſe of ſo Bleſſed a Truth; but therefore come in, lay down thy weapons, with which thou haſt been fighting againſt God; wilt thou hold up rebellion, and yet cry pardon? Is it equitable thou ſhouldſt expect it? No, fall down at the feet of that God againſt whom thou haſt ſo <hi>greatly</hi> ſinned, in the poſture hath been ſhewed thee; and then though <hi>ſin hath abounded, yet grace doth much more abound,</hi> Rom. 5. laſt. <hi>Great</hi> Sinners have become <hi>great</hi> Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you?</hi> Who were they? Idolaters, Adulterers, Revilers, Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch like. You that have been ſuch like, God may have as much Glory in your pardon as he hath had diſhonour by your Sin: Only be not ſuch a <hi>Devil</hi> to thy ſelf, as to turn thy back upon it, and when thou haſt thus long rebelled, to tell God, he muſt ſtay thy leiſure for thy acceptance of his pardon, thy Sins are too ſweet to leave as yet; I tell thee, Soul, and I have ſhew'd it, that Gods pardons coſt him dear, and are precious; and if thou deal thus, they may be lockt up in Heaven from thy wretched Soul to all Eternity. Who but a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wretch, but would take mercy and grace from Heaven, that may make him bleſſed for ever, when God offers it by his dear Son, let thy Sins be never ſo great? why, wretched Man or Woman, Haſt thou not done God wrong enough already! but muſt thou ſtay yet longer in thy curſed Sin, and wrong him yet more? Haſt not done enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to damn a thouſand Souls, but wouldſt do more, and make as ſure of Hell as thou canſt? I beſeech thee, Sinner, great Sinner, young or old, do not put
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:172030:22"/>
me off, nay, do not put the Lord off with a pardon in his hand, a promiſe of Grace ready to be ſealed by the Holy Ghoſt, if thou wilt now, from thy Soul, readily ſay, why then be it ſo, Lord Jeſus I come to thee; if the terms be leaving all this deceitful Sin, and to be made like unto thee, be it ſo, I accept of it, tear my luſts from my heart, I have ſerved them long enough, too long; Oh now, if there be any mercy in Heaven, let me have it, ſave me, (not in) but <hi>from</hi> my Sins, Oh Lord, for they are <hi>great, great</hi> indeed; <hi>I will, ſaith the Lord,</hi> and he ſpeaks it in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.29. <hi>I will ſave you from all your uncleanneſſes;</hi> 'tis as much as if the Lord ſhould have now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it from Heaven, Mark every tittle in ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe! Now thou cryeſt, Oh, <hi>will, will</hi> the Lord ſave? <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith the Lord; Oh but, will he ſave me <hi>from</hi> ſuch <hi>uncleanneſſes,</hi> yea, from uncleanneſſes; what from <hi>All?</hi> yea, from <hi>All</hi> thy uncleanneſſes; fall down and Adore, and cry out, Oh grace, free, rich, infinite, glorious grace; admire, Angels, Saints, Sinners, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold one of Gods wonders, <hi>A great ſinner ſaved.</hi>

ever ſuch a ſoul get to Heaven? ſhall I not be the wonder of Heaven and Hell, how I got to Heaven, and eſcaped that wrath into which thouſands, that were better than I, are now plunged? there's no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, but becauſe mercy is great, greater than the greatneſſes of Sin, with which I ſhall conclude the ſecond Point, namely, When Sinners come on to find pardon, they ſee their Sins <hi>great.</hi>

                        <p>Obſ. 3. <hi>The great reaſon of Gods pardoning a ſinner; and the plea that a poor convinced ſinner hath with God, is, that he will pardon for his own Names ſake.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For thy <hi>Names ſake,</hi> Oh Lord, pardon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is, not for any worth that is in a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not for <hi>my</hi> ſake, but for thy <hi>own</hi> glories ſake, thy mercy ſake; grace and mercy will be hereby glorified. God gets himſelf a Name by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of a poor Sinner, that <hi>Name</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34.6. The Lord merciful and gracious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, God hath given forth the ground of this plea in the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> where his Name is thus made moſt glorious. And when he had given forth a brief and bleſſed draught of the tenor of the <hi>New Covenant, Ezek.</hi> 36.21. The Lord gives out this as the great reaſon often mentioned, why he would take ſuch a way of making another Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wherein he <hi>wills</hi> all, <hi>undertakes</hi> all, <hi>does</hi> all, <hi>works</hi> all, as reſolved it ſhould be a Covenant, and a way of grace that ſurely ſhould hold: He gives out this, I ſay, as the ground of all, <hi>I had pitty for my own holy Name,</hi> ver. 21. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I do not this for your ſakes, but for mine holy Names ſake,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>I will ſanctifie my great Name,</hi> ver. 23. And when the Lord had ſhewed what he would do for the poor
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:172030:23"/>
Jews in ſpecial, and ſo for all Sinners taken into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, that he would <hi>ſprinkle clean water upon them, cleanſe them from their Sins, give them a new heart, put his Spirit upon them, write his Laws in their hearts,</hi> and ſo take them to be <hi>his people,</hi> he again concludes with the ſame ground as before, that all this was ſtill for his own <hi>Name,</hi> ver. 32. <hi>Not for your ſakes I do this, be it known unto you, &amp;c.</hi> And yet, that he would as certainly and fully do it, as if all the engagements from man in the world had been upon him, as <hi>undoubtedly</hi> make good every part and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Covenant, he adds, ver. 36. <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it, and I will do it;</hi> you may ſafely abide by it: Neither ſhould his grace and power come hardly from him (as poor doubting ſouls ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) as if 'twere as much as ever the Lord could do, to give out mercy and grace to poor Sinners; but, ſaith the bleſſed God, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place upon the ſame account, having given out the promiſes of Grace in the New Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.37. and ſo on, He ſubjoyns, — <hi>I will do it with my whole heart and my whole ſoul;</hi> mark it, poor ſouls, <hi>with my whole ſoul,</hi> will I pardon you, love you, never turn away from you to do you good, and never ſuffer you to turn away from me. If poor ſouls (for whoſe ſake I put it) ſhould here ask, what is this Covenant, what do you mean by it? only a word here. God at firſt, when he made man, agreed with man to be his God, to give him life for ever, upon theſe terms that man would keep the Law that God gave him, and 'twas a Law that would have given all glory to the Creator, preſerved the creature in a holy and bleſſed order, and been a bleſſing to the whole Creation; but man tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing here, the bleſſed God from his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:172030:24"/>
                           <hi>for his names ſake,</hi> gives out another Covenant, provides in it terms of reconciliation, for the firſt breach of the firſt Covenant, ſends his eternal bleſſed Son Jeſus Chriſt, to be a mediator of this new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, gives him commiſſion to <hi>offer</hi> it to all, and that freely; and to let the World know, that if any Sinner in the World, never ſo great, come and put up his plea, make his claim, enter his claim, accept of this Covenant and new agreement with God, accept of the terms of it, give up himſelf mutually to God back again; then will God be his God, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better terms than before with <hi>Adam,</hi> pardon, own, love, bleſs, unite to himſelf, never ſuffer him to fall; mercy built upon an unmoveable foundation, <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19.</p>
                        <p>This briefly is the meaning of the New Covenant, upon which all our mercy is built; now from firſt to laſt, from the firſt to the top-ſtone of it, from Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Glory, all is done and made good for the Lords own glorious Names ſake. Souls elected, the Covenant tranſacted between God and Chriſt, Jeſus Chriſt ſent, the Sinner called, forgiven, juſtified, ſanctified, adopted, kept, glorified, All for his Names ſake; See the promiſes running thus, in moſt places, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions.</hi> Why? <hi>for my own ſake; Purge away our ſins for thy Names ſake,</hi> Pſal. 79.9. This is the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all. This name he hath revealed in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.21.</p>
                        <p>Now, becauſe the further clearing of this bleſſed truth is my deſign, through Grace in the next diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſhall ſpeak but a word more by the way of uſe only.</p>
                        <p>

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If it be thus, that whatever God gives out
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:172030:24"/>
to poor ſouls, is for his <hi>own Names ſake,</hi> that this is the plea a poor Sinner hath; let it then be for your information and inſtruction, that you have no other plea to be heard in Heaven but this, (the plea of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt being upon the ſame bottom) Don't make a ſorry pile of carnal duties and works, and ſay, for the ſake of theſe, Lord do me good, and pardon where I have failed; the Lord may ſend fire from Heaven to conſume thee and them, becauſe of their pollution, and that 'tis a curſed offering, but never hear thee, and bleſs thee upon ſuch a plea; No, no, ſay in thy ſoul, and that from full conviction, If ever I have any thing from God on this ſide Hell, it muſt be for his own Names ſake; I expect, I plead, I wait, upon no other ground.</p>
                        <p>

                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If the Lord's Names ſake be the only plea for grace, then let poor Sinners drawing near to God by Jeſus Chriſt, be perſwaded that 'tis a <hi>good</hi> plea, and moſt acceptable before the Lord. Now this is the way of the heart of poor creatures, from rooted ſelf-love and pride, we think, if God could give out good unto us for our ſakes, it were ſomething; if there were any thing to be beheld in us that were commendable to the Lord, I could go with ſome confidence; but ſeeing 'tis thus, that I am nothing elſe but vile before him, how can I go to him? with what face? or, how can he give out unto me? Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; be as low as thou wilt or canſt; but reaſon not ſo with thy ſelf. If God can as freely, as fully do thee good, all good, for his own Names ſake, and hath thereby the more glory by it; why ſhouldeſt thou ſo ſtand upon thy terms with God, and not be as willing, as contented, to accept of Mercy, all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for Gods own Names ſake, as well as for <hi>thy</hi> ſake?
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:172030:25"/>
'Tis thy pride, be it known unto thee Sinner, as thou thinkeſt thou art, and not thy lowlineſs; know, for thy comfort, God can more readily, eaſily, do thy ſoul good, upon the terms he now is, for his own ſake; and ſo the thing be done, thy ſoul pardoned, bleſſed, ſaved, and all ſhall end in everlaſting love upon thee, let the Lord have all the Glory, though thou haſt nothing to boaſt of for thy own ſake. And yet alſo know, that when the Lord ſaith, he doth it for his own ſake, he doth not exclude that he hath <hi>no</hi> reſpect and love unto thee; but that the great and higheſt motive with God was, and is, his own Name, his own glorious grace, why he ever had a thought of good to an undone creature; that there was no motive in the creature, unleſs miſery, which is no glory; but all is done, given, eſtated upon ſouls, undone, poor Sinners freely, for his own ſake.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Let it exhort ſouls to make uſe of this plea, therefore, and that with great, though humble <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> It never failed poor Souls ſince the world was, that made uſe of it when they were low and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and eyed and pleaded mercy for mercies ſake, they had it, and never went away but bleſſed.</p>

                        <p>HAving ſpoken, as the Lord hath helped me, as to the weight of the pardon of ſin, and the way to it; I now come to open the compleating this mercy in a poor ſouls compleat <hi>juſtification</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. So it hath pleaſed the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God to order the way of his glorious mercy to poor Sinners that ſhall be ſaved, that he doth not only let forth free grace for the remiſſion of their ſins, and meerly pardon them, but hath ſo bleſſedly ordered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to bring them in a ſtate of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect righteouſneſs, as <hi>Adam</hi> in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:172030:26"/>
eſtate was in, not by making the Sinner perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally holy and righteous in himſelf, in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by giving out his eternal Son Jeſus Chriſt, to fulfill all righteouſneſs in their ſtead, by ſatisfying and keeping the perfect Law of righteouſneſs, which is <hi>imputed</hi> to the Believer as if he had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it, and were wholly righteous in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; in which lies the great myſtery of the Goſpel. I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. for <hi>therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt whereby God will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, put in a ſtate of righteouſneſs, made over to them by faith that ſhall be pardoned and ſaved.</p>
                        <p>To endeavour to evince and diſcover the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of ſuch a <hi>juſtification,</hi> and the <hi>nature</hi> of it, and how a poor ſoul comes to be <hi>inveſted</hi> in it, to have a <hi>right</hi> unto it, is my deſign, as the Lord ſhall graciouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in this enſuing diſcourſe. Oh that I might do it in the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, plainly, convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpiritually, as I ought to ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>In the proſecuting hereof, I ſhall firſt ſhew that righteouſneſs is not to be attained any other way, not by the exacteſt keeping of the Law, ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to God; not by ſetting our ſelves to keep the Law of God as well as we can, and ſo we hope God will accept of it; which being naturally rooted in the hearts of all, I find it the hardeſt piece of conviction, and moſt hardly received of any other; ſouls are a thouſand times more eaſily beaten off groſs ſins, than beaten off the confidence of the good they think they do, and ſo come as <hi>Nothing elſe</hi> but ſinners to Jeſus Chriſt; want of this conviction makes all the Hypocrites in the world. This is that part therefore I ſhall firſt begin
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:172030:26"/>
with, according to the Apoſtles Method in this Epiſtle.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle lays down his Doctrine, which he was to prove in the 17th. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 1ſt. <hi>Chapter, The juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> to make way for which, he firſt proves in the remaining part of the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> that the Gentiles knowledge of God, which they had by <hi>the things that are made.</hi> The Creation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God over the world, left them in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs becauſe they <hi>held the truth</hi> (of the being of a God) <hi>in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> even the wiſeſt and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt of them, ſuch as <hi>profeſſed themſelves to be wiſe,</hi> verſe 22. and brake forth into Idolatry and all abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, <hi>for which cauſe God gave them up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 26, 28. At the 17th. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 2d. <hi>Chap.</hi> The Apoſtle undertakes the Jew, ſtrikes off all his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and at the 9th. <hi>verſe</hi> of the 3d. <hi>Chapter,</hi> concludes both Jew and Gentile, in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as to the obtaining of ſuch a righteouſneſs by the Law, that might commend either to God; <hi>What then are we,</hi> (who are Jews) <hi>better than they,</hi> (who are Gentiles?) <hi>No, in no wiſe, for we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Jews and Gentiles are all under ſin; As it is written, there is none righteous, no not one:</hi> Which he further proves by ſeveral Scriptures to the words of the text.</p>
                        <p>In which the Apoſtle prevents an objection, namely, that ſome might urge, The Scriptures ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged may concern ſome few and groſly wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not all mankind in general: No ſuch matter; <hi>whatever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the law,</hi> which are all the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Adam,</hi> as in their natural corrupt eſtate; All under the Law, from whence the Apoſtle infers, (1.) That therefore <hi>every mouth is ſtopped,</hi> (2.) All
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:172030:27"/>
the world is guilty before God. (3.) That no fleſh, within or without the Church, can be juſtified by the Law. From whence I draw theſe four plain ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, to prove what is my main deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man can attain to ſuch a meaſure of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by all that ever he can do, in his beſt keeping the Law, as may commend him to God; which four are theſe.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Every Son and Daughter of</hi> Adam <hi>in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eſtate are under the Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>That a Tranſgreſſor of the Law hath nothing to boaſt in, nor to excuſe himſelf from his ſin, or the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment of God due unto him.</hi> [That every mouth may be ſtopped.]</p>

                        <p>I intend briefneſs in the opening of theſe, and what <hi>plainneſs</hi> alſo the Lord ſhall help me with: This is a principle <hi>rooted</hi> in the hearts of all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men: That ſtill there is a ſufficiency in them to keep the Law of God, in ſuch a meaſure as God will accept them for it; This being heightened, by the ignorance of times, and darkneſs of Goſpel light, and of the New Covenant of Grace, upon the ſpirits of this Generation, they are moſt hardly beaten off it; ſay poor ſouls, If I keep Gods law as well as I can, and worſhip God, and do not harm my Neighbour, God will accept me, and pardon where I fail; but to be convinced that all that keeping of the law is made void by one ſin, and ſo ſee an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of righteouſneſs, another way and out

of themſelves by Jeſus Chriſt, though it be preacht by many good men, yet few, very few, in this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration live in the practical ſenſe and ſight of it; yea, how many profeſſors (not hereby to reproach any) have confeſſed to the Glory of God, and their own abaſement, that ſince the breaking forth of a fuller light of the nature of the New Covenant, Goſpel Grace, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they have been ſhaken in their bottoms, being legal, and thought if they took up from their ſins, and had a kind of ſorrow for them, and then ſet themſelves to obey the law ſtrictly, be cloſe in the Sabbath, and ſome ſuch duties, that God would accept them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill ignorant, at leaſt practically, that when they were convinced of ſin, they were to ſee where to have a <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> and how to get into Chriſt, and have life and ſtrength in and from him for their new Obedicence; which is that I drive at in this, and my afterwards diſcourſe in opening the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>in</hi> Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Having premiſed this, I come to ſpeak to the firſt particular laid down, namely,</p>
                        <p>Obſerv. 1. <hi>Every ſon and daughter of</hi> Adam in <hi>their natural eſtate are under the Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By the Law, I do not mean the Moſaical or old Teſtament way of worſhip: But by the law, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that which we ſtile the moral law, the law of the ten Commandments, that was written in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> heart, and afterwards given out by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Moſes</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and promiſed in the New Covenant to be written again in the hearts of all that are really called into the grace of ihe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27.</p>
                        <p>To be <hi>under the Law,</hi> is an Expreſſion familiar to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:172030:28"/>
you, you know what it is to live under a law: To be under this law of God then beſpeaks theſe things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To be <hi>under it,</hi> is to be bound over to the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act</hi> fulfilling it: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the righteouſneſs which is of the Law, that the man which doth theſe things ſhall live by them;</hi> that is it, to be bound over to the fulfilling and doing of the law, which if done exactly, without the leaſt devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is life promiſed to it: But upon the leaſt tranſgreſſion of it, to be liable to the penalty which God hath pronounced againſt the tranſgreſſors of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It follows thence, that to be <hi>under the Law,</hi> is to be bound over <hi>to the whole Law,</hi> in its full and <hi>perfect</hi> latitude, as it reacheth the whole Man. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them:</hi> Mark well the tenour of theſe words: Here is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>every one</hi> an exact <hi>doing</hi> (not only <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing</hi> and <hi>thinking</hi> to do;) and that not only of ſome or the moſt of the Law, <hi>but in all things;</hi> and that not only for a time, but a <hi>Continuance</hi> of doing ſo, or elſe under the curſe: One ſinful thought hath a curſe belonging to it, as well as the breach of the whole Law, if under the Law. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever committeth ſin, tranſgreſſeth alſo the Law,</hi> 1 John 3.4.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To be <hi>under the Law,</hi> is to be <hi>ſubject to, and to be under</hi> all the curſes, threatnings, judgments, wrath, that it threateneth to the tranſgreſſors of it, here and for ever: Whatſoever the Law ſaith, in point alſo of judgment and wrath, it ſaith to all that are under it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. To be <hi>under it,</hi> is to be bound to <hi>make God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:172030:28"/>
in our own perſons for the breach of it; I mean, while under it, every ſoul is ſo obliged to make ſatisfaction, to the juſtice of God: If a poor ſoul be in his natural eſtate, and ſo under the Law; he muſt ſtand or fall to the Law: God expects perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſatisfaction from every ſoul that ſinneth againſt it, that will ſtand to his keeping the Law, in whole or in part, and God in his juſtice can bate nothing of what he hath ſpoken.</p>
                        <p>Now, That all Men and Women are by nature, as of and in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> thus under the Law, to wit, to be bound up to it, and to have life only upon the exact and perfect fulfilling of it, to be bound up to the whole Law, ſubject to the curſe of it, upon the tranſgreſſion of <hi>one part,</hi> bound to make God <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in his own perſon for any breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I briefly prove.</p>
                        <p>Saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>Ye are not under the Law, but under grace;</hi> Implying, till a ſoul is brought under grace, the Covenant of grace, juſtifying and ſanctifying grace, in and by Jeſus Chriſt, he is <hi>under the</hi> Law, whoſoever he be; ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.5. — <hi>To redeem them that were under the law,</hi> &amp;c. implying alſo that all mankind are naturally under it, till under the power and efficacy and priviledge of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                        <p>The main reaſons of it are,</p>
                        <p>All are under this law, becauſe all Mankind were bound up under the ſame Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> who was a publick perſon, repreſenting all mankind, as a man may bind up himſelf and his poſterity to ſuch and ſuch Conditions; and ſuch a Covenant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or obligation binds his poſterity in Law, ſo was <hi>Adam</hi> bound up to God; See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Scripture that proves this truth; <hi>Wherefore as by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:172030:29"/>
one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned:</hi> So <hi>verſe</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19. <hi>by one that ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by one mans offence death reigned by one; by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation: By one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners:</hi> Implying clearly, that the guilt of <hi>Adam,</hi> as repreſenting all his poſterity, was and is imputed to all; <hi>and therefore all were, and are bound over to the ſame Law;</hi> bottomed upon that word of the Lord to <hi>Adam,</hi> by which God put the Covenant upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>For in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Adam</hi> had the law of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, the Moral Law, written in his heart before, and his nature perfect, which bound him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to obey every command of his God; now God gave out that external law unto him by way of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in which the form of the Covenant was implied; but ſinning againſt that, he tranſgreſſed the Moral law, written in his heart alſo, which bound him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to obey God in all things; ſo that the ſin of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was (at leaſt virtually) a tranſgreſſion of the moral law, now abiding and obliging mankind; which law we all brake in him, as it was given to all in him, and being written in <hi>Adam's</hi> heart, it was as much as if it had been actually written in the hearts of all mankind; which doth alſo appear by the remnants of the Law, (as that there is a God, and man ſhould be juſt,) and remaining in the hearts of all: Therefore by nature we are all bound up to, and are under this law.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It doth appear that <hi>all</hi> do ſin and tranſgreſs this law of <hi>God,</hi> therefore <hi>they are under</hi> the penalty and condemnation of it: This Argument the Apoſtle brings to prove the ſame thing, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. of this 3d.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:172030:29"/>
of the <hi>Rom.— For we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under ſin:</hi> And verſe 12. <hi>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one;</hi> Thefore ſeeing all do ſin, they are bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the law (as you uſe to phraſe it,) and are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to whatſoever the Law pronounceth againſt the tranſgreſſors of it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. All the <hi>partial</hi> keeping of the Law, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a Soul from that penalty that belongs to the breach of the whole: Keep me all or none, as to your deliverance from the curſe, ſaith the law. But this I am further to prove, when I ſpeak to the next verſe, The impoſſibility of a ſinners being accepted by his beſt keeping of the law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Are all Men and Women in the World, young and old, naturally under the law, <hi>bound over to the moſt exact and rigorous fulfilling it under a curſe,</hi> and are indeed under all the curſes and threatnings it pronounceth, and bound to make God ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in your perſons, while you are under it? Oh! let every poor Sinner be convinced of it, what a ſtate is this for any poor ſoul to reſt it ſelf ſatisfied in? who is the man or woman that is not a tranſgreſſor of it? and therefore ſee to it, and that before the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of judgment come upon thee without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Sinner, if thou waſt condemned by the Law, and under a ſenſe of death, how wouldſt beg for a reprieve? and beg of all thy friends to interpoſe for thee; what an amazing word would it be to thee? <hi>Thou art condemned to dye.</hi> Ah ſinner, 'tis the caſe of thy precious ſoul, Thou art condemn'd to eternal death, by the law of God, the ſentence is pronounc'd from the righteous Judge of Heaven; Away Sinner,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:172030:30"/>
with all ſpeed to a <hi>Mercy ſeat.</hi> Acknowledge thy condemation juſt by the Law, go to the great and potent <hi>Advocate</hi> of Heaven, Jeſus Chriſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; put thy caſe into his hand, tell him thou baſt none elſe to make to, and that thou haſt heard he hath helped many a condemned Sinner, in the ſame caſe as thou art; and that thou haſt heard he hath laid down a price for ſuch as thou art to redeem them from the curſe of the Law: Follow him, and if he ſpeak but a word to the juſt and great God for thee, the ſentence of the law is remitted, a pardon of grace comes forth, and at laſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall be ſent from the Father, and the Son to <hi>witneſs</hi> it, <hi>and ſeal</hi> it in thy own Conſcience; and that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed word ſhall be thine, <hi>Therefore there is now no condemnation,</hi> &amp;c. who ſhall condemn me, ſince Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath cleared me? and hath made the Court of Heaven for me? Go and ponder in thy ſoul every day; and ſay, Is't nothing to be under a Curſe? condemned by a Law to be damned for ever? ſhall I let my poor ſoul lie in ſuch a caſe one hour longer, eſpecially when a way I hear is open'd to me to get from under it? Say, what ſatisfaction can I, wretched creature, make to the righteous God? None, but by ſuffering what infinite juſtice will lay upon me, which is no leſs than infinite puniſhment. Oh! get in upon thy conſcience, what it is to be <hi>condemned</hi> by the great <hi>God,</hi> to lye under guilt, to have <hi>no plea</hi> or <hi>excuſe</hi> by the Law left thee; which I will labour to prove to thy conſcience, and then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther urge thee, which is the import of the next point.</p>
                        <p>Obſer. 2. <hi>A tranſgreſſor of the law, as he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to boaſt in, ſo he hath nothing to excuſe himſelf for

his ſin, or from the righteous judgment of God due unto him;</hi> which is drawn from theſe words —<hi>That every mouth may be ſtopped,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>This the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Therefore thou art inexcuſable, O man,</hi> &amp;c. ſpeaking to the <hi>Jew</hi> who went about to free himſelf. And <hi>the judgment of God is according to truth, againſt them which do ſuch things,</hi> verſe. 2.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. A poor ſinner hath nothing to excuſe himſelf for ſinning againſt the law of God, <hi>becauſe the law is good and righteous,</hi> Rom. 7.12. <hi>Therefore the law is holy, and the Commandment holy, juſt, and good,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was under ſuch a Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinning againſt it as we are preſſing; So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8. <hi>But we know that the law is good,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis a Law that gives glory to the Creator, and all good and bleſſedneſs (as in it ſelf) to the Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A Law that's full of all wiſdom and bleſſedneſs, takes care for the good, bleſſing, peace, order of the whole Creation, that man might not ſin againſt his Maker, nor, in the leaſt, harm (nor think to do ſo) his fellow creature, ſo that its proper end is good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, preſervation to all; Now what excuſe for a creature, moſt concern'd in the good of it, for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt ſuch a Law? what hath a creature to ſay for himſelf? how inexcuſable is he before God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Men?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. God writ this holy and bleſſed Law in the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was a publick perſon, whereby he, and in him all mankind, had <hi>power</hi> to keep it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſinner hath no excuſe before God; He gave man a power, though he did not lay a neceſſity upon his will, but left them to the liberty of it, but man corrupted himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.12. Whereby he diſabled himſelf from keeping the Law: Now if a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:172030:31"/>
himſelf, it can be no rational excuſe for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duty, ſo that his Mouth is ſtopped as to any plea or excuſe before the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Though man had blurred and defaced the fair and original Copy of this holy and good law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his heart, yet God gave it forth again by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in Legible Characters, one end whereof was to leave all Mankind without excuſe; therefore this ſtrikes off all plea for the ſinner, eſpecially to ſuch to whom it is revealed.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is a remnant of this Law yet in the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> which though not ſufficient to enable him to an exact performance of it, yet enough to leave him without excuſe; ſo <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2.15. to prove this point we are now upon, ſpeaking of the Gentiles, — <hi>Which ſhew the works of the Law written in their hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> There is enough of the law remaining in every mans heart to accuſe him, when he doth evil; and excuſe him ſo far as he doth right, though man by habitual ſinning, doth much ſtifle it; ſo that this alſo helps to aggravate his ſin, and to leave him without all plea or excuſe.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. There is that to be known of God, in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that may and doth leave a ſinner without all excuſe for ſinning againſt him; this the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues as to this very purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of him from the Creation of the World, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and god head, ſo that they are without excuſe,</hi> &amp;c. The creatures could not ſay, we will make our ſelves thus and thus, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſuch an order and harmony; therefore there was one firſt Infinite Being, who made all things, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:172030:31"/>
by the ſame power doth uphold them, to which <hi>firſt Being,</hi> all the creatures muſt owe their homage and conformity: Now though ſuch a glimmering of light can never ſuffice to lead a ſoul to the true worſhipping of God, as the Apoſtle there argues, yet it leaves the creature without excuſe, which is that I am proving from it.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. All the Children of men do ſin <hi>preſumptuouſly, wilfully,</hi> and <hi>obſtinately,</hi> againſt the Law of God; mans ſin being not ſo much from his weakneſs to obey the law, (though weak he is) but from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of his will againſt God and his law; as it is in the caſe of diſobeying the call of the Goſpel alſo: Now whatſoever a man doth preſumptuouſly and wilfully, it leaves him without all excuſe; and this is it that is charged upon the Children of men, by the holy Ghoſt in the word, that their ſin was obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate rebellion againſt the great God.</p>
                        <p>From all theſe, the truth of the Aſſertion doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that every Tranſgreſſor of the Law is without all excuſe before God.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. As the Creature hath no excuſe for his ſin, ſo it follows he hath no pretence againſt the righteous judgment of God; <hi>We are ſure the judgment of God is according to truth,</hi> Rom. 2.2. and Chap. 3.4. That thou may'ſt be juſtified in thy ſavings, and clear when thou art judged; that is, whatever any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may diſpute to the contrary, God is righteous when he judgeth; if the Law be juſt, and holy, and good, once written in his his heart, and had a power to have kept it, that God hath given out this law again to him, the remnants of it in his heart, ſo much to be known of God in the Creatures, and that he ſins preſumptuouſly and wilfully againſt God, and ſo bleſſed a law, made for his own good, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:172030:32"/>
muſt every ſinner conclude, the Lord is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous when he judgeth, and every mouth muſt be ſtopped.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If it be ſo, that no ſinner in the world hath any juſtifiable excuſe for his ſin, then let this truth come in into your conſciences, and ſtrike off all vain pretences, and wretched excuſes, when you have ſinned againſt the Lord; which uſually are ſuch as theſe, when ſinners break forth into this or that rebellious way, they cry, Oh! 'tis my nature, my natural diſpoſition; and then they think that excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth or allayeth the matter, whereas it aggravates, for we our ſelves corrupted our natures. Saith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, I have been ſo accuſtomed to ſuch a way, to drink to exceſs, ſometimes to ſwear, to uſe the Lords name vainly, and as a by-word; whereas the cuſtom of ſinning is the greateſt and moſt grievous aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Saith another, 'tis my company that draws me, or the example of others, or 'tis my temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when they are under the Spirit that worketh in the children of diſobedience: Or, that they do keep the Law as well as they can, and think this will excuſe: Whereas nothing, no plea that ever a ſinful deceitful heart put up, or that the Devil ſuggeſts, can before God excuſe any ſinner in the world, rich or poor, knowing or ignorant, from the exact and perfect keeeping of the Law, (if they are under the Law) but upon one tranſgreſſion of it, the law doth moſt juſtly condemn and curſe them.</p>
                        <p>Nothing is more natural to fallen man, under ſin, than when having ſinned, to deviſe an excuſe, and thinks and ſurmiſeth, that becauſe ſuch an excuſe will be taken by his own blinded Conſcience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will alſo accept of it, and ſo <hi>flatters himſelf
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:172030:32"/>
in his own eyes, till his iniquity be found to be hateful,</hi> Pſal. 36.2. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> as ſoon as he had ſinn'd, he thought how to excuſe the matter, puts it off to the woman, and the woman to the Devil, which trade ſinners have well learnt, and have driven it on ever ſince to their own damnation: Obſerve this, if every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet under the law, and the power of ſin, had not ſome vain pretence and excuſe to enſilence conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and fooliſhly thinks to inſinuate unto God, he or ſhe, muſt needs fall down before the Lord, ſee all their pretences and coverts to be damnable flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſoul-cheatings, and ſo <hi>Judge</hi> themſelves, and pronounce God moſt righteous, if he damn them for ever.</p>
                        <p>Oh therefore, Sinners, Away with all your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, no more excuſing, but judging, and go to the great God, and fall down at his feet, crying out, Oh, I am a Tranſgreſſor, the Law condemns me, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe will be taken, my mouth is now ſtopped; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God do with me, he is moſt holy and righteous. If I were going to Hell I muſt juſtifie God, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay unto him, why doeſt thou thus? Thus 'tis with a poor ſoul, when the Lord by his word and ſpirit diſcovers ſin, reveals the law, lays it in upon the conſcience, diſcovers the Holineſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs of his Juſtice, that the law ſhews no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but crys out for fulfilling, or pronounceth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute condemnation, then I ſay, a ſinner crys out, Oh I am caſt by the Law, I am gone by the Law, All my Pleas are found too light, All my endeavours to keep it is worth nothing, if guilty in the leaſt, while I am under the law. I muſt find out a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs elſewhere, another way, or Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, juſt condemnation is my portion for ever; Here's the firſt ſtroak of a convinced ſinner, when
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:172030:33"/>
                           <hi>God</hi> is outing him from himſelf, and all his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts or Excuſes, and brings him naked to put on the righteouſneſs of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, freely held out in the Goſpel; which is the work in hand.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If no excuſe can be heard or taken, for the the tranſgreſſion of the Law, for but one breach of it, but every mouth is ſtopped; how much leſs will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excuſe be taken, for withſtanding the Goſpel of grace by Jeſus Chriſt. Saith our bleſſed Lord, <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin,</hi> (that is not ſo great ſin and comdemnation) <hi>but now they have no cloak</hi> (nor excuſe) <hi>for their ſin;</hi> If a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous law leave all the world without excuſe, much more a Goſpel that offers free grace, and pardon, and righteouſneſs, by Jeſus Chriſt to any ſinner, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Law, that will come in, as ſo condemn'd, and accept of the free gift of Righteouſneſs by him.</p>
                        <p>But that I may yet a little further labour to bring in the ſenſe of Guilt upon the ſoul, I ſhall prove eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul <hi>guilty before God</hi> of the tranſgreſſion of the Law, and ſhew what the ſenſe of guilt is, which few there are that have, in a ſaving way.</p>
                        <p>Obſerv. 3. <hi>Every ſoul in the world is guilty before God of the tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi> — And all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
                        <p>This hath been proved, where we have ſhew'd that <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>guilt</hi> is threefold, which is ſet home upon every ſinners heart, when convinc'd of ſin by the ſpirit.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, which ſtands charg'd upon every ſinner in the world, while under the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="63" facs="tcp:172030:33"/>2. The guilt of the <hi>corruption of our natures,</hi> ſin in the fountain, as I have ſhewed, which is likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Son or Daughter of <hi>Adam, they are all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi> Pſal. 14.1. wherein lies the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The guilt of <hi>actual rebellion</hi> againſt God, ſin brought forth, and acted in the outward man againſt God.</p>
                        <p>Now under this threefold guilt is every ſinner in the world, while under the Law, the effect of which, if not reconciled, is puniſhment ſuitable to the guilt; which is — Thou ſhalt ſurely dye, And <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> Eternal Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>laſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This may therefore <hi>inform</hi> and <hi>convince,</hi> that every ſin brings <hi>guilt</hi> upon the ſoul, and ſo deſerves death and everlaſting wrath from God; you that make light of ſin, to lye, to prophane the Name of the Lord, be in worldly diſcourſes on the Lords day, in any way of ſin whatſoever, weigh this in thy conſcience, there's not the leaſt ſin but makes thee <hi>guilty</hi> before the Tribunal of God; God, the Law, Angels, Conſcience, are all witneſſes againſt thee; where's the ſoul that will think to avoid this charge? ſhall I prove every ſoul of you guilty, and that before God? If this were proved by the power of the word in the conſcience, I know what (and I ſhall ſhew it you) will be the effect of it; lay your Conſciences to the Word, and if thou art found <hi>guilty</hi> before the Lord this day, go home with the ſenſe of it upon thy ſoul, and do as a <hi>guilty</hi> ſinner ſhould do.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Conſider firſt, as to what concerns God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; the Law requires, thou ſhouldſt have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:172030:34"/>
no other Gods but him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. which Jeſus Chriſt interprets, is, to love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul: Now, hath God had thy whole Heart and Soul, dareſt thou ſay ſo? Hath not the world had more of thy Heart than God? Doſt not thou love the World, and the things of it? Do not thy Affections, Thoughts, Deſires of thy Heart, even day and night, go after it? Yea, you cannot but grant, that 'tis ſo? Then God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are witneſs, that thou art guilty of the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſin of Idolatry. And ſuch a one ſhall not, as ſuch, enter into the Kingdom of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. Know by that Scripture, A covetous heart may ſend thee to Hell, as well as any ſin in the World: — <hi>No Covetous man who is an Idolater, ſhall enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Read over the place every day, and tremble at it: Here's guilt already enough to damn thee.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thou haſt worſhipped God ſuperſtitiouſly and idolatrouſly, after the <hi>Traditions</hi> and <hi>Commandments</hi> of Men: You that are elderly people, are all guilty here in a grevious manner in the time of your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuperſtition, coming to Sacraments with ſins upon your Souls, from which ſins your are not converted, and changed to this day, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>eating and drinking damnation,</hi> or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; under which guilt you ſtill lye, and would heap up more of this guilt, were not ſome more tender of your Souls than your ſelves? Art thou not now ready to cry out, Oh hold, hold, you need go no further, my Conſcience is ſmitten: Oh! guilt, great guilt lyes upon me! Oh that 'twere the cry of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls before the Lord, how might it end in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that ſhall be for ever!</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:172030:34"/>3. But yet further to purſue thy Conſcience, (for that's the nature of guilt) doth not the Lord require in his law, that thou <hi>ſhouldſt not take his Name in vain, Exod.</hi> 20.7. Now ſinner, ſtave off this guilt if thou canſt: How oft haſt thou abuſed and profaned this great and dreadful Name, the Lord thy God, by ſwearing, or in thy by words, crying, <hi>Oh Lord, Oh God, for God's ſake, for Chriſt's ſake,</hi> upon every fooliſh vain occaſion, with no more reverence of His Name, than the moſt common name in the World? And ſome of you have, as many days as you have lived ſince your Child-hood, been frequently guilty of this great evil, which thou haſt made a ſmall matter of, which if ever God pardon it, it will appear to be odious guilt, from the height of thy Heart-Atheiſm. How oft haſt thou heard the Word, and thy Heart been after the World, and thine eyes gazing up and down, that 'tis eaſie to diſcern thou regardeſt not what is ſpoken from God to thee? and the ſame in Prayer: How oft haſt thou babled over the Lords Prayer like a Charm, with no reverence of Gods Majeſty upon thy Soul: In thy bed, it may be in a drowſie manner, or if otherwiſe, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Words thou ſpeakeſt, much leſs thy Heart affected with them; or, it may be, ſaying over the Creed, and the Commandments, or ſome Book of Prayers, as abundance do, grievouſly prophaning God's Name, and offering Lip-labour, which his ſoul abhorreth; yea, know, what hath been often proved, that thy prayers, and all thy worſhip, and good deeds, (as thou calleſt them) are an <hi>abomination</hi> to the Lord, while thou art in thy ſin, an unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and unholy perſon; yea, the way of thy worſhip, in which thou placeſt thy greateſt confidence, hath been the higheſt aggravations of thy ſin, in offering
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:172030:35"/>
up to God that which his ſoul hateth; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. — <hi>When you make many prayers</hi> (ſaith the Lord) I will not hear you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And as to the ſanctifying the Sabbath, which thou ſhouldſt make a <hi>holy</hi> reſt unto God, thou haſt made it a meer <hi>fleſhly</hi> reſt, conſuming the day upon thy luſts, in vanity, idleneſs, carnal and worldly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes in families, in the ſtreets, to the high diſhonour of the Name of God, and hardening of thy heart againſt the truths of God, rendering thereby the preaching of the Goſpel wholly unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to thy ſoul: A carriage far unlike a man that hath the grace of God upon him, and a moſt invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument to thy Conſcience, that thou makeſt not God, his word, ordinances ſabbaths, a holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and knoweſt not the excellency and ſweetneſs of Communion with him; ſay, ſinner, and lay thy Conſcience to this conviction, is hearing and that with love, praying, praiſing, meditating, conferring of holy things, the very Heaven of thy ſoul, and ſo longeſt for ſuch Exerciſes, as the joy and ſtrength of thy heart? Nothing leſs! Thy own Conſcience being Judge; but hear drowſily and negligently, it may be deſpiſingly; revile the Preacher, ſpeak evil of the word, out of thy groſs ignorance, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to be reformed, ſpeak vainly, carnally, worldly, with ſuch as are like thy ſelf. Here's guilt enough to ſend thee to a thouſand Hells, if <hi>God</hi> ſmite not thy heart for it, and thou turn not unto him for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and a better heart to be given to thee.</p>
                        <p>Add to all this, an unthankful and unholy uſe of <hi>Gods</hi> good Creatures; it may be thou haſt been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by the devil, and thy own ready heart to ſome ſecret ſins, which thou thinkeſt enough if thou canſt hide from man, not conſidering the judgment of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:172030:35"/>
                           <hi>God</hi> that hangs over thee. But if not ſo, yet a heart full of uncleanneſs, envy, wrath, malice; which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in his opening the Law in its ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21, 22, 27, 28. convinceth to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and adultery, which it may be, thou haſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſidered of, ſo thou haſt not been an actual adulterer, or murderer. In a word, There's not a vain thought in thy heart, the firſt riſing of it, but brings thee under the guilt of condemation of the Law, and as thou art under the Law, as if a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor in thought, word, and deed of the whole Law; This may ſeem ſtrange to thee, but ſee it proved, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point is guilty of all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it hath been proved that thou art <hi>guilty</hi> of the breach of every Commandment of God, from thy youth up.</p>
                        <p>But ſee further, ſinner, (that ſome word of God or other may hit thee) this Law could not condemn thee; wouldſt thou have been convinc'd of guilt, and made in to grace by Jeſus Chriſt, but thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of Goſpel-contempt; Come ſinner, ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, ſee what I can and will do for thee, I'll ſave thee from this condemning Law, I'll take away the curſe, I'll remove all thy guilt, blot out all the charge that is againſt thee, I'll put a righteouſneſs upon thee, I'll beſtow my ſpirit upon thee, I'll give thee a heart to love God and his Law, and in the inward man to delight to walk in it, and then take thee to Heaven, and fill thee with glory for ever. All this Heaven of mercy and free grace thou haſt ſleighted and ſinned againſt, and brought thy ſelf under greater condemnation, than by the law: And yet, by the way, Jeſus Chriſt will do as much for thee ſtill as I have ſpoken of, and more:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:172030:36"/>
Though thou haſt thus ſinned againſt Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, if thou wilt come a poor, undone, guilty ſoul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, which is that I aim at in thus preſſing upon thee; and were the ſenſe of guilt indeed upon thy ſoul, thou wouldſt ſeriouſly hearken to me.</p>
                        <p>Therefore yet further bear with me, Take home this guilt to thy Conſcience, and ſay, Oh <hi>guilty, guilty,</hi> of all that hath been this day charged from the righteous God upon me! Oh may the Lord find thee out this day, and lay in the freſh ſenſe of the guilt of ſins, even of ſuch thou haſt long ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted! do not <hi>juſtifie</hi> nor <hi>excuſe</hi> thy ſelf any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for that's the natural way of thy heart, as thou haſt been ſhewed. Never did guilty priſoner at the bar find more ſhifts, more ſubtle pleas, than the proud and ſhameleſs heart of a ſinner will do, till God himſelf pronounce guilt in the conſcience, and then the guilt of one ſin laid in, brings in the guilt of all other, and they ſometimes come in like waves and billows upon thy ſoul; Oh, let the ſenſe of thy lying, ſwearing, prophaning the Sabbath, ſlighting the word, refuſing Jeſus Chriſt, out of thy ſecret hatred of holineſs, reproaching the people of God, becauſe in their practice they condemn thee, Oh let this, any, all, ſeize upon thee, go and lye low before the great God, judging, charging, condemning thy ſelf, and ſay; God and his Word hath found me out this day, and I go home with at arrow of God in my conſcience, I am the Man or Woman, that am found the guiltieſt ſoul in the Congregation; how to be delivered and ſaved from it, that's my buſineſs now. Bleſſed be the advice and counſel now, (which formerly I deſpiſed) of any good man that ſpeaks in the Name of the Lord unto me, and will ſhow me there is yet hope for ſo wretched a creature as I am.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:172030:36"/>Particularly, theſe are the effects of the ſenſe of the guilt of ſin, wrought by the Holy Ghoſt upon the conſcience of a poor ſoul, in order to his ſalvation.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Fear of wrath to come, more or leſs, poſſeſſeth the heart; can a man be guilty and not fear, if truly ſenſible of it? This was upon <hi>Adam,</hi> after he had ſinned, and heard Gods voice, which ſtruck him with ſenſe of guilt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. <hi>I heard thy voice and was afraid;</hi> ſo when guilt came upon <hi>Belſhazzar, his thoughts troubled him,</hi> Dan. 5.6. <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. The <hi>Jaylor</hi> came <hi>trembling,</hi> Acts 16.29. The fear of wrath, the fear of a miſcarrying ſoul, the fear of eternity, ſeizeth upon the ſpirit of a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and then 'tis an infinite weighty matter with a poor ſoul to be ſaved.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Shame</hi> is another effect of <hi>guilt</hi> brought in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conſcience: So <hi>Adam</hi> likeweſe was aſhamed, and <hi>hid himſelf,</hi> becauſe he <hi>was naked,</hi> Gen. 3. <hi>What fruit had you in thoſe things whereof you are now aſhamed;</hi> Rom. 6.21. <hi>So</hi> Ezek. 16. <hi>laſt. That thou mayeſt remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towards thee, for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord;</hi> See alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.10, 11. Oh how is a ſenſible guilty ſoul aſhamed before God, Angels and men, of ſuch ways and carriages, in which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently before delighted himſelf? and lies down in his ſhame and confuſion of face, even covering his face before God, and aſhamed to look up unto him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The ſoul walks up and down with a <hi>burthened</hi> ſpirit, thoſe creature-comforts, delights, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which before would ſtill the ſpirit, now will not; ſenſe of guilt eats out the hearts of them, the ſoul muſt now have ſomething elſe than wind and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:172030:37"/>
vanity, (for ſo are creatures become to ſuch a poor ſoul:) It may be the deceitful heart carries a poor creature to this thing and that, but finds no ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction there, the burden ſtill remains, the arrow that God hath ſhot ſticks faſt, till Jeſus Chriſt pluck it forth, and heals all with his Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Guilty ſouls make out for deliverence, ſue to Heaven, are enquiring how the law may be ſatisfied, how guilt may be removed, how attonement may be had, how bondage taken off; in a word, how he may come to ſee the face of a bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> reconciled in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo love him, and bleſs him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
                        <p>Why now, careleſs ſinner, Is't not better be thus, than be hardening for Hell? and have the guilt of ſin as nothing to thee, till the books ſhall be opened? all thy ſins written in Letters of Blood againſt thee, Conſcience accuſed, charged, and witneſſing againſt thee, and ſo away ſcreeking to Hell without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and canſt not be heard a word for thy ſelf, nor any one, Saint, or Angel for thee? Now thou mayſt be heard, if thou wilt ſpeedily acknowledge thy guilt, not <hi>cover thy tranſgreſſion</hi> nor <hi>hide thy iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thy boſom,</hi> Job 31.33. but come with fear, and ſhame, burthen'd with thy guilt, to him whoſe arms are yet open to receive thee, and is ready to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way iniquity off thee, and take off thy burthens, put his hand under thy ſoul: And if thou wouldſt know who it is, 'tis that bleſſed Jeſus who loves to ſave ſuch a ſinner, as he loves his life; therefore away to him.</p>
                        <p>But the heart of a guilty ſinner will now urge; Well, if it be ſo, that ſome guilt is upon me, yet I have done many things well, or as well I could,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:172030:37"/>
will not that take off my guilt, and will not <hi>God</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the good to me, and paſs by the evil? Or will not <hi>God</hi> acept of the will for the deed? Or if I ſet my ſelf for the time to come, to keep the law as well as I can, will not that make <hi>God</hi> amends? Alas, poor ſoul, theſe refuges will undo thee, if thou get not out of them; No, No; Thy good ſhall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, nor thy will accepted, nor thy obedience for time to come ſatisfie; I mean, ſtill as thou art under the law, <hi>As well as thou canſt,</hi> will not be heard here; If thou indeed gets juſtified in Chriſt, and rooted in him, and ſo from a new principle of life in thy ſoul, thou bring forth new and holy obedience, then thy will is accepted, and thy new obedience, but not upon this account, as to juſtifie thee before <hi>God;</hi> or as to expiate and take off guilt from the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>This therefore is the next thing I am to prove to thy Conſcience, if <hi>God</hi> will, Namely,</p>
                        <p>Obſerv. 4. <hi>No man or woman under Heaven, can ever arrive at ſuch a keeping of the law, as to be accepted with God, for and by ſuch a keeping of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I would preſs this as plainly as I may, for till this conviction be thoroughly and practically received into the Conſcience, a ſoul cannot make a ſaving cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>What I mean by theſe deeds of the Law, is, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, underſtood; I mean, The profeſſed owning the true God, and frequenting his ordained worſhip and ordinances, obſerving the Sabbath, making good prayers, doing ſome good, as to helping thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and giving of Alms, making conſcience of wronging or defrauding any man, and refraining many groſs ſins; I mention theſe things, becauſe moſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:172030:38"/>
men that go thus far, as your more civil ſort of people, think that it is impoſſible, but God muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them in and for all this; that 'tis for great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be damned, they thank God they are not ſo; by the way, ſoul, I ſhall not doubt to prove, that there's more hope of the vileſt drunkard in the Country, than of ſuch a one; and that this thy good keeping of the law, and that as well as thou canſt, will ſtand thee in no ſtead at all; and God looks upon thee no more for it, than if thou wert the greateſt ſinner in the world; How ſayeſt thou ſoul to this?</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From clear Scriptures I ſhall demonſtrate it, and Scriptural reaſons, and examples of ſuch kind of perſons rejected of God, and ſo labour to drive this nail home upon thy conſcience.</p>
                        <p>What need we go further than the words of my Text; <hi>By the deeds of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight?</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to own and make conſcience of keeping the law, as well as they could, ſuch as were within (as you call it) the pale of the Church, and frequented the worſhip of God, and were ſober people: See Act. 13.39; — <hi>From which</hi> (meaning their ſins) <hi>they could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes: They <hi>could</hi> not! an utter impoſſibility of it, though they kept the law of God as well as they were able, and hoped for pardon thereby, yet ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> (which exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly troubled them) they could not be <hi>juſtified</hi> thereby; Rom. 9.31. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after the law of righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the law of righteouſneſs;</hi> Though they followed after it, and laboured to keep the Law of God to their utmoſt yet they fail'd of their purpoſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 11. &amp;c, <hi>For as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are of the works of the Law, are under the curſe,</hi> that is, ſuch as inſiſt upon works of the Law, they are ſo far
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:172030:38"/>
from being the more accepted for all the good they did, and all the evil they refrained, that they were under the curſe, as well as any ſinners in the world beſides.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, <hi>Paul</hi> who well knew the experience of this, it having been his own caſe, as I ſhall ſhew, ſpends two Epiſtles, of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galathians,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince chiefly what I am now upon; therefore peruſe them over and over.</p>
                        <p>Now the Reaſons of it are theſe, namely, why a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinners keeping of the Law to his beſt power, can not juſtifie him, or make him the better, or at all accepted with God for it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q>This doctrine goes to the quick, and I know naturally you do not love it, and 'tis irkſom, and diſquieting;</q> the Lord make it diſquieting and unſettling to purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. The beſt keeping of the Law cannot make a ſoul more accepted with God, (while under the Law, and not in Chriſt) <hi>becauſe of the holineſs of Gods Juſtice,</hi> which being violated by ſin, (it being alſo proved that <hi>all</hi> do ſin) cannot again be made up by any act of the Creature, the ſeverity of his juſtice cannot admit of it, therefore if the Law be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, the ſinner muſt dye, as he is under the law, and ſtands to the law, or God is not righteous, which to aſſert is execrable blaſphemy. And if your thoughts ſhould prevent me, with a general notion of mercy, know, and conſider it well, that the law ſhews no mercy, but calls for juſtice, and juſtice it ſhall have upon every tranſgreſſor whoſoever, if he <hi>ſtand</hi> to his endeavour to keep the Law; <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall dye.</hi> From whence, by the law, I ſay, by the law, there's no appeal: What you may do when you renounce the Law, for righteouſnes, and fly

wholly to a mercy-ſeat, is another caſe. This is the firſt reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The beſt keeping of the Law will not accepted, <hi>becauſe of the exactneſs of the Law;</hi> it requires <hi>full, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, perfect</hi> fulfilling and obedience, or all ſtands for nothing; If this were throughly weighed and laid to heart, we ſhould come to an iſſue in the point. Mark that Word, Gal. 3.12. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the law to do them:</hi> I think I opened this place lately, but mark it well; the Law requires of every one, and therefore of thee, whoever thou art, a <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> (without intermiſſion) of <hi>doing</hi> (not only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and endeavouring) <hi>All things,</hi> not keeping nine, and breaking one Commandment; not keeping it outwardly, and breaking it in thy <hi>thoughts</hi> of ſin, but in <hi>All things,</hi> or <hi>Curſed,</hi> without remedy, by the law, the Law can give you no remedy; ſee Rom. 10.5. <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the righteouſneſs of the law; The man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them;</hi> If he <hi>doth</hi> all things of the Law, not purpoſeth them only, but doth them, he ſhall <hi>live</hi> by them, but not otherwiſe, but ſhall dye, and that for ever, by the law: Now mark you, The ſame Law can't at once juſtifie and condemn, bleſs and curſe, quit and judge, ſave and condemn, if it therefore condemn in the leaſt, it cannot quit by all that ever a ſoul hath done, or may do, towards fufilling it. I inſtanced before, if a man that lives under the law of <hi>England,</hi> all the laws of it, and he be found a tranſgreſſor of one law, that is to be puniſhed with death; it will not be a good plea for him that he never brake any other law that deſerves death: No, ſaith the Judge, you muſt dye for this; ſo as I have ſhew'd, the law pronounceth death to the breach of any <hi>one</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:172030:39"/>
any part of one, as well as to the breach of the whole. Therefore he that pleads, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee did, (and was never the more accepted,) that he is no murtherer, no blaſphemer, no thief, no adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer; 'tis all one, as if thou haſt ever had an unholy thought in thy heart, (as thou haſt had thouſands) as thou art under the Law, thou art condemned; if this indeed had been the tenour of the law, as it was a Covenant between God and the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that if thou and thy poſterity ſhall <hi>endeavour</hi> to keep the law as well as you can, though you ſail in ſome part, yet you ſhall be accepted; then this had been a good plea before God, that you have ſo endeavour'd to keep it; but 'tis not ſo, the Covenant doth not run ſo, but, as hath been ſhewed, it runs thus; Here's a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and righteous law, ſaith God, the matter of the Covenant between us, if you break it in any one leaſt part of it, and but once, you are condemn'd, and all your other righteouſneſs ſhall not be imputed to you. This hath been proved from ſeveral Scriptures; and I think 'tis the hardeſt thing in the World to be ſpiritually and practically convinced of it; ſuch is the exactneſs of the Law, that it admits of no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, of no terms whatſoever; it ſtill crys, fulfill me to the utmoſt, or dye.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third Reaſon, which ſtrikes off all hope of acceptance with God, by keeping the Law as well as you can, is taken <hi>from the ſinfulneſs of thoſe very duties and works which you place ſuch acceptance in;</hi> There is a ſinfulneſs in every ſuch duty, though the matter of the duty be good, yet the manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it by any natural man is wholly ſinful; yea, there's a mixture of ſin in the moſt holy performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of any regenerate ſoul in the world, which he is ſenſible of; but I am dealing with the natural man,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:172030:40"/>
as to his opinion of his good keeping the law; I ſay there's nothing but ſin in their performances, the principle they proceed from is wholly ſinful, <hi>viz.</hi> a corrupted, polluted heart and nature: Can a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tree bring forth good fruit? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.18. Can a corrupt fountain ſend forth ſweet waters? <hi>James</hi> 3.11. No more can a corrupt defiled heart bring forth any duty or work, but what is loathſome to God, full of all impurity: This a natural man is not able to ſee, nor conſider of, till convinc'd by the Holy Ghoſt, and therefore 'tis that he reſts only in performing the matters and bulk of duties to God and his Neighbour; but with what heart, and the unholineſs of it, he weighs not. Upon this account it is, that the Scriptures ſpeak at ſuch a rate of natural Men, that they are an <hi>abomination</hi> to the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.8. That his <hi>ſoul hates them,</hi> he <hi>cannot away with them, they are iniquity, they are a trouble to him,</hi> Iſa. 1. And that he caſts them back, <hi>as dung upon their faces,</hi> Mal. 2.3. Therefore if there be more than ſin enough, in that beſt keeping of the Law, towards God or Man, to damn a ſoul for ever; Certainly a ſoul ſhall be never the better, nor at all accepted for ſuch a keeping of it. That which in it ſelf hath ſin, nothing but ſin in the manner of it, cannot be a means to quit a ſoul from other ſin, by which he hath brought guilt upon himſelf, let this be well conſidered, and (nothing but a Chriſt) would be your cry to purpoſe indeed.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The fourth Reaſon or Convincement of this truth, that the beſt endeavour to keep the law, will not give you more acceptance with God, nor take away any guilt from off thy ſoul, is becauſe <hi>ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and keeping the</hi> Law, <hi>are but of the outward man,</hi> which is far from reaching the Compaſs of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:172030:40"/>
law: <hi>The law is ſpiritual,</hi> Rom. 7.14. that is, it reacheth to the inwards parts, to the motions of the heart, as hath been before hinted, and not only to the outward man; therefore our bleſſed Lord, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jews</hi> inſiſting ſo much that they were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly blameleſs, ſpends a large diſcourſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. to beat them off their confidence, in being outwardly righteous, and proves a man a murderer by the Law, for one wrathful thought in his heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21, 22. Upon this conviction you have him, as oft as he ſpake to the <hi>Jews,</hi> (that we may ſee the weight of this Doctrine:) See Luke 16.19, 15. <hi>And the Phariſees alſo, who were covetuous, heard all theſe things, and they derided him, And he ſaid unto them, ye are they which juſtifie your ſelves before men, but God knoweth your hearts, for that which is highly eſteemed amongſt men is an abomination in the ſight of God;</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was convincing the wickedneſs of a covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart, the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were carnal and formal, made a ſlight matter of this, ſeeing they were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly blameleſs, and wronged no body; Ay, but, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>God knoweth your hearts,</hi> and his eye is moſt upon them, and though you are outwardly righteous before men, and this is a matter highly eſteemed of among men, that you are righteous and blameleſs, yet 'tis an abomination to God; ſee how ſevere the Lord is in preſſing of this, (it being the great let of his Miniſtery, and of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbling at the Goſpel, as it is with us) <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. his laſt Sermon I conceive he preacht to them, <hi>verſe</hi> 25. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, Hypocrites, for ye make clean the outſide of the cup and platter, but within they are full of extortion and exceſs;</hi> ſo with the ſame woe pronounced <hi>verſe</hi> 27. <hi>Ye are like unto whited ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:172030:41"/>
are within full of dead mens bones, and of all uncleanneſs;</hi> verſe 28. <hi>Even ſo alſo ye outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of Hypocriſie, and iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> Mark the Lords words, <hi>within</hi> ye are thus, and thus, as if the Lord ſhould ſay, God regards not what you are <hi>outwardly,</hi> and your obſerving the law with the <hi>outward</hi> man; ſeeing you have abundance of all iniquity <hi>within,</hi> which every unregenerate ſoul in the world hath; ſo you may ſee that an <hi>outward</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the law, ſtands for nothing in the account of God, whatever it do with men and your ſelves which you hear Jeſus Chriſt gives forth, as the mark of an <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> Now you have heard, the law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires inward as well as outward perfection, perfect holineſs <hi>within,</hi> as well as righteouſneſs in the outward man; I verily believe, want of this convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the ſoul, ſends more ſouls to Hell than any other thing in the world beſides; how confident are poor Creatures if they are a little conſciencious in dealing, and ſober, and blameleſs to men? this you may be, and be no better than Devils (as in your ſelves) in Gods account, and thy beſt Character from Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.26. is, a <hi>Blind Phariſee.</hi> Every place, I fear, abounds with them, therefore this inveterate curſed plea of being outwardly blameleſs in keeping the Law, will not in the leaſt render you more accepted with God, but 'tis at the beſt but painted Hypocriſie: And yet, wretched ſouls that you are, none ſo well perſwaded of themſelves as theſe. This is the fourth Reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. All the beſt keeping of the Law, <hi>doth not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, make ſatisfaction to God for one ſin of thy ſoul,</hi> therefore 'tis worth nothing; Gods Juſtice is wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if the ſinner be remitted, God muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by the ſinner himſelf, or by another; Now all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:172030:41"/>
the obedience of a ſinner cannot make ſatisfaction to God in the leaſt; if he had the whole world to offer up to God, it could not ſatisfie him for the wrong of one Sin; See that known place, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God? ſhall I come before him with burnt offerings, with Calves of a year old? will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, or with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Rivers of Oyl? ſhall I give my firſt born for my tranſgreſſion, the fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?</hi> Implying that there is nothing that a poor ſinner of himſelf can offer up to God, to make atonement of ſatisfaction to God, for the leaſt ſin of his ſoul; ſhould he offer up thouſands of prayers, rivers of tears, whole ages ſpent in ſervices to God, take up to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere new obedience, if you ſhould ſo take to a new courſe as never to ſin more all your days, it would not make God ſatisfaction or atonement for one evil thought of thy ſoul: Now obſerve this, (for if thou art not rightly convinced of this thing, thou art loſt for ever) 'Tis naturally upon every man and womans heart, that hath ſinned, to imagine that when they have ſinned, they can put off God, as to his diſpleaſure, with ſomething or other, they will reckon what good they have done, gone to Church, (as you ſtyle it) given Alms, been juſt to Men, or ſome ſuch thing; and the poor blind Creature ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines and pleaſeth himſelf in it, that this good thus done will well enough <hi>pacifie God</hi> for his ſins, or at leaſt he will go over ſome prayers, and be ſtrict for a little while, and then they doubt not but <hi>God</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo he preſently ſmites not with judgment) is well enough appayed, and he need no more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf. Is not this the very way of your hearts, hath not the word found you out?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="80" facs="tcp:172030:42"/>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay; <hi>why</hi> cannot theſe duties and this obedience <hi>ſatisfie</hi> and <hi>pacifie</hi> God well enough for ſin?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe there <hi>is ſin mixt in them,</hi> they come from a prophane heart, as is ſhew'd in the laſt reaſon, (thou thou ignorantly, becauſe thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not thy heart, call'ſt it a good heart:) Now that which is in it ſelf ſinful, cannot ſure <hi>ſatisfie</hi> for ſin.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe of the <hi>infiniteneſs</hi> of God's juſtice, as well as purity of it; a <hi>finite</hi> creature cannot offer up a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable</hi> attonement to an infinite God. Suppoſe a poor man were under the guilt of treaſon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to dye, and he ſhould go and offer up a little courſe broken bread to the Prince, would any one think that this would ſatisfie the Prince for his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? So, poor deceived creature, thou art guilty of treaſon and rebellion againſt the great and moſt high God, and thou comeſt and offereſt up to him thy poor polluted broked obedience and duties, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt he will be ſatisfied with this; whereas God may in the ſame moment juſtly ſend thee to Hell for the iniquity of them. A poor ſinful ſoul thinks, that becauſe ſuch doings and ſervices do ſatisfie himſelf, his own conſcience, therefore he thinks they will ſatisfie God alſo; becauſe they quiet him upon any trouble for guilt, he thinks they will alſo quiet God, and take off his anger and juſtice from puniſhing him: Poor Creature, this thy way is thy folly, and the ready way to come under the ſevere juſtice of the Almighty, who will not thus be dealt with, nor be thus bribed with thy curſed ſacrifices; this is a further convincement of the point; all the creature can do, cannot pacifie God for one ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his beſt keeping of the law cannot juſtifie a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:172030:42"/>
poor ſinner before God, nor give him acceptance in the leaſt with him; till he ſees pacification another way, and takes up obedience from another principle, and to another end, as we are to ſhew.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. All a mans endeavour in ſetting himſelf to keep the law to the utmoſt, cannot give him acceptance with God, <hi>becauſe it cannot give life to the ſoul;</hi> Gal. 3.21. <hi>For if there had been a law, which would have given life, verily righteouſneſs had come by the law:</hi> Man hath procured death and weakneſs upon his ſoul, and the law cannot give life, nor ſtrength to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it. All that righteouſneſs which leaves the ſoul dead, comes to nothing; while a ſoul is under the law, and upon the fulfilling of it, (as he hopes in a good meaſure) ſtill the ſoul is as dead as ſin left it, and void of the life of God: True, a poor ſoul thinks himſelf alive by his legal performances, as <hi>Paul</hi> thought, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. but he is <hi>dead</hi> in ſin, and under the ſentence of death by the Law, and all the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances towards the keeping of it, can never give a drop of life to ſuch a poor ſoul: They are dead works, and there's no life in them, or from them, therefore they ſtand no ſoul inſtead, while under the law, as under it he is, whiles he goes upon this account.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The main reaſon of all, which is now but to be touched, is this: If a ſoul endeavouring to keep the law of God as well as he can, may be accepted of God thereby, what need Jeſus Chriſt to have dyed: 'Tis <hi>Pauls</hi> great argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own ſon, in the likeneſs of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fleſh, condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the law might be fulfilled in us,</hi> &amp;c. Mark ye, what the law <hi>could not</hi> do, that it could not give us a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:172030:43"/>
whereby God might accept us, therefore God ſent his Son in the fleſh, and condemned ſin upon him, which otherwiſe had been condemned upon the ſinner himſelf: Another place to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>laſt. I do not fruſtrate the grace of God; for if righteouſneſs come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> If there were a poſſibility of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures attaining to ſuch a degree of keeping the law as well as he can, that might render him accepted with God, and procure pardon wherein he failed, then the dying of Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>in vain,</hi> to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at all. Take heed you that are outwardly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that you do not fruſtrate the grace of God, and the death of Jeſus Chriſt for ever, to your own ſouls, by thinking you endeavour to keep Gods law as well as you can, and make ſome conſcience of it, and there fix your hope wholly or in part, and ſo be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. Another place in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. ſpeaks out the ſame truth. <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his ſon made of a woman, made under the law; to redeem them that were under the law; that we might receive the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sons.</hi> What need Jeſus Chriſt to have dyed, to redeem the elect from under the law, if they had been able to reach forth to ſuch a keeping of it, that God might be well pleaſed with, and with them in it?</p>
                        <p>Now Jeſus Chriſt's <hi>being made under the Law,</hi> implies theſe things, which I now but hint forth.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His being under the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of the Law, which was due to ſuch as were under it; what ever the Law pronounced to the Tranſgreſſors of it, Jeſus Chriſt in effect did undergo it, See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the law, being made
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:172030:43"/>
a curſe for us:</hi> If good prayers, making a conſcience in dealing, outward ſobriety, harming no body, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Alms to poor people, could have taken away the curſe, did the wiſe and bleſſed God do well in giving out his Son to be made a curſe? were prayers, righteouſneſs, good deeds made a Curſe? They will be indeed, in another ſenſe, if thou thinkeſt to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt being made under the Law, was <hi>to ſatisfie Gods offended juſtice</hi> for the breach of the Law, for ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, <hi>to make attonement for God,</hi> Rom. 5.11. If now all that thou haſt done, or ſhalt ever do, could make the leaſt ſatisfaction or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement to God, in thy good keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments as well as thou canſt, (as hath been ſhew'd) God might have kept his Son in Heaven, and not ſent him to make <hi>attonement</hi> for any ſinners.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To <hi>reconcile</hi> ſinners unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,</hi> &amp;c. If reconciliation to God can be had no other way, but by the death of Jeſus Chriſt, will thy good endeavours for the time to come to keep the Law of God as well as thou canſt, and take up from a looſe courſe, will thoſe, I ſay, reconcile thee to God? See, poor creature, how little need thou thinkeſt thou haſt of Jeſus Chriſt, and what a meer notion a Saviour is to thee, when it comes to the Tryal!</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Jeſus Chriſt died to <hi>work out Righteouſneſs</hi> for all that ſhall be ſaved: Now if thou could'ſt come up to ſuch a degree of being righteous, by thy fair and good carriage, as thou thinkeſt, to God and Man, this righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt was to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:172030:44"/>
Righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now ſee, miſtaken Soul, how they hope to pleaſe God well enough, and make him amends for thy ſin, by thy good endeavours to ſerve him in his Law, as well as thou may'ſt, makes void the whole deſign of God, in the glorious gift of his eternal Son, (as much as in thee lyeth) and robs him of the Glory of his Grace; and makes thy Salvation (if it might be had in ſuch a way) not of Grace, but of Debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Now to him that worketh is the reward, not reckoned of debt but of grace;</hi> and thus thou in effect becomeſt thy own Saviour.</p>
                        <p>Yet bear with me a little further, (becauſe a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can never be too thoroughly convinced of this matter) let me ſhew you ſome <hi>examples</hi> in the Scriptures, of ſuch that thought as you do, and as all men naturally do, that they by their honeſt and conſcionable endeavour to worſhip God, and harm no body, they ſhould be ſaved; and yet were found light in the ballance.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is that Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. He thanks God, <hi>he was not as other men are, Extortioners, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, Adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. Here was hope for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, He was not ſo bad as <hi>others,</hi> as many riotous prophane perſons were, not <hi>unjuſt</hi> in his dealings, no <hi>Adulterer,</hi> and ſhould any one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his Salvation and going to Heaven? Enough for great ſinners to miſs of Heaven, and not ſuch as he was, reputed a good and honeſt man in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and amongſt his Neighbours well thought of by moſt. And yet for all this confidence and ſecurity, a great ſinner was accepted before him, and he not juſtified in the ſight of the God, though he was in his own ſight, and the ſight of others.</p>
                        <p>See another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. (which place hath
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:172030:44"/>
been at large opened to you) There came a young man, a man of parts, with the ſame confidence to reaſon with Jeſus Chriſt about his condition, the man conceived he wanted nothing that a man ſhould have or do for Heaven; <hi>All theſe things,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I have kept from my youth up;</hi> meaning eſpecially the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table of the Law, which Chriſt gave out, not as thereby to put him upon the Law, but to find him out, and diſcover him under the Law. When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſearched the mans heart, and finds him under the power of the love of the world, as a reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul damning Sin, (for all his outward blameleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) and ſo to diſcover his heart to himſelf, puts him upon tryal of Self-denial; away the man packs as mute as a fiſh, and would hear no more, (as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings now) of ſuch Doctrine; unleſs he could be a Diſciple, and part with nothing, loſe or venture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he would reſt as he was, and hope his being an honeſt ſober man, and well thought of, would bring him to Heaven; and ſo, for ought appears, cheated his Soul to Hell.</p>
                        <p>The caſe of <hi>Paul</hi> hath been often ſhew'd you; he was, as many of you think your ſelves, <hi>blameleſs, Phil.</hi> 3.6. lived in no known ſin outwardly againſt the Law, frequented the publick Worſhip, made Conſcience of his dealings, was zealous of the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and cuſtoms of his Fathers, and yet do you not hear him crying out of it all <hi>as loſs,</hi> ver. 7. and 8. He thought it was his <hi>gain</hi> before, that it would have gained him Heaven, but now tis all loſs, his keeping the Church, his outward blameleſneſs ſtands him not in the leaſt ſtead, but cryes out, 'tis <hi>All, all loſs for Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> the ſame <hi>Paul</hi> that before boaſted, and thought very well of himſelf, and was in much peace, and perſecuted all beyond his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal

If it be ſo, that the beſt endeavour of any mortal creature to keep the Law of God as well as they can, will not give them acceptance with God; then you that have ſo imagined, and thereby ſpoken peace to your ſelves, namely, that you hope if you keep the Church (as you uſe to ſpeak) and harm no body, and do any body any good you can, live not in groſs ſins, be well thought of by your neighbours, you ſhall do well enough for Heaven, and you muſt <hi>hope well.</hi> Ah poor creature, thou erreſt, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way of the Lord, nor of thy own heart; how art thou befooling thy ſelf, and deceiving thy own ſoul.

you would leave, becauſe it may damn you, if conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in, but your righteouſneſs, your confidence in it, you would not leave, becauſe you hope that ſhall ſave you, and pacifie God for you; and this will be your ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, if you ſtick here.</p>

(2.) A good converſation, that witneſſeth a hope of Heaven, is alſo a <hi>holy</hi> converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. To be inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy as well as outwardly righteous. Now thy care lyeth moſtly about thy outward blameleſneſs, and not thy <hi>inward holineſs,</hi> therefore thy converſation, which thou calleſt good, is not a ground of hope to thee. (3.) Or if thou doſt pretend to a little outward holineſs, and thinkeſt thou haſt a good heart, yet thou doeſt not <hi>walk in Chriſt,</hi> becauſe thou haſt not, as a poor ſelf-emptied ſinner, <hi>received</hi> him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6.

and power for any ſpiritual duty, or thy walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, from Jeſus Chriſt, by vertue of union with him, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. the experience of which thou art ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of; (4.)

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Truly, ſoul, I muſt needs deal plainly with thee, 'tis to <hi>no purpoſe</hi> as yet, if this be thy condition, that thou haſt done any thing, as to the ſaving of thy own ſoul; and yet thou muſt not leave off, as if thou mighteſt live as thou liſt: No, Thou muſt begin anew, (as thou wilt be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more at large directed;) firſt, ſee all thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doings, either towards God or Man, to be <hi>loſs,</hi> becauſe thou haſt done them by meer natural or legal principles, and wrong ends, and ſo it ſtands for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and then fall down before Jeſus Chriſt, Oh 'tis <hi>thy</hi> righteouſneſs now, Lord, I come for; 'tis <hi>thy</hi> ſpirit, I muſt have to quicken and ſtrengthen me in

the way of my obedience; and ſo pray and hear, upon other grounds, to be taught of God, to receive the Spirit, to have communion with God, but not thereby in the leaſt to be accepted. But this I ſhall open further, when I ſhew why and how a Soul muſt obey God, though he be not thereby juſtified. So this Objection is removed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 3. <q>But, you will ſay, I hope I do not <hi>reſt</hi> upon my own doings, no more than others, I think no body doth ſo, will you ſhew me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the heart is apt to do ſo?</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will, and ſhall diſcover to you, that <hi>the heart of man is moſt naturally apt to reſt upon an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward keeping of the law, and to build a hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Heaven upon it;</hi> this I muſt a little inſiſt on, as much conducing to help on the conviction I am preſſing, if the Lord by his power ſtrike in with it.</p>
                        <p>If it were not <hi>natural,</hi> (nothing more) for a ſoul to <hi>bottom</hi> upon its keeping the Law, though fallen and unable to it; the Apoſtle would never have ſpent time in the <hi>Conviction</hi> of it, which he ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly doth in this and the former <hi>Chap.</hi> It hath been the great evil upon the hearts of the Sons of Men, in all ages of the Church: One of the firſt Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> was under it; <hi>Cain,</hi> when he reſted upon the bare ſacrifice: 'Tis that the Prophets of God are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, convincing the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> of, more than of any one thing whatſoever; See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. <hi>throughout;</hi> Iſa. 66. Jer. 7. Ezek. 33.31. <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of</hi> Hoſea, <hi>in the main bent of it,</hi> is to convince the formality of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their falſe confidence in reſting in their heartleſs doings and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="92" facs="tcp:172030:48"/>In this caſe Jeſus Chriſt finds the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in, at his firſt coming, in reſting in ſome heartleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances in God's worſhip, and outward righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards men, which he ſharply rebuketh, and convinceth them of the vanity of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 18, 21, 23, 25. <hi>Chapters</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> with which you may compare the other Evangeliſts, and ſee how much ado the Lord Jeſus had to beat them off from this confidence, and how few of them were beaten off it: And <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, that upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground they were rejected of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. Not upon the account of groſs outward ſin, but for their being conceited of their good condition for Heaven, becauſe of their frequenting publick worſhip, and being blameleſs in the ſight of men; yea, from this natural principle (joyned with the deluſion of the Tempter) did the Church of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into the Synagogue of Satan, as Antichriſt roſe in the world, firſt truſting in the performance of their worſhip and works, which brought in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and ſuch kind of Sacriledge againſt Jeſus Chriſt, and all other Trumperies, to build fallen men upon his own bottom, and to deviſe a way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to God, wherein they failed; to which the hearts of Men are moſt naturally carried, which made that Doctrine ſo eaſily and generally over-run the world. Againſt which accurſed Doctrine, that famous Witneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luther</hi> began his main battery; and though the Doctrine of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt be known to the Proteſtant World, yet practically to be brought over to it, by an Union with Jeſus Chriſt, is but (we may fear) thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known or underſtood, yea, not only by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpirits of <hi>England,</hi> that reſt in a Notion of being <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but even amongſt many who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:172030:48"/>
ſomething beyond it, as I before have hinted; yea, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt profeſſeth to expect to find multitudes of Profeſſors at his coming under this ſoul-damning ſnare, of <hi>being found in themſelves,</hi> and in their own righteouſneſs, and not in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25, &amp;c. By all which it may am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply appear how <hi>eaſie,</hi> how <hi>natural</hi> a thing it is for the hearts of the Children of Men, to bottom their confidence in what they <hi>do</hi> towards God and Man, in their <hi>obedience</hi> of the Law, as to place their <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance</hi> in it.</p>
                        <p>Add to this the reaſons of it, why the hearts of all the ſons and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> are naturally apt to reſt upon the law, and their own doings, and to hope for peace by it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Every natural man, hath ſomething of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi> of the Law, which God at firſt wrote in the heart of our common Father <hi>Adam, Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. which being a little drawn forth by the Letter of the Law, it makes a poor creature ſet himſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep the law, and hopes to attain to ſuch a degree as to be accepted with God for it: Now there is no ſuch thing in the heart to come to Chriſt, or to have righteouſneſs in another; therefore a ſoul ſets himſelf to the Law, and endeavours more or leſs, the keeping of it naturally.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Man would fain make up the breach he hath made with God, <hi>upon his own account:</hi> As a Man had naturally rather do a thing himſelf, than be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another; therefore upon Conviction of guilt he ſets himſelf to make up the breach, to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> God by ſome attonement or other, that his own heart can contrive; his ſorrowing and repenting he hopes may pacifie God, or ſome new ſacrifice of more performances, or being better for the time to come:
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:172030:49"/>
Thus the heart works ſecretly, and upon his own account; God letting forth ſome mercy (as he thinks) where he fails, he hopes to make up any breach that ſin hath made between God and his ſoul; and thus he is ſtill upon the Old Covenant, under the law.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A Sinner is more apt to keep to the Law, than go to Chriſt, <hi>from a ſecret pride of heart;</hi> he would not be found at a <hi>total loſs</hi> with God, to be wholly <hi>undone,</hi> and <hi>unable</hi> to do any thing towards his own peace and ſalvation: A ſoul naturally had rather part with all ſin, and have his nature made perfectly holy, than be quite undone in himſelf, and come to have all his righteouſneſs in another, in Jeſus Chriſt. And here it is, that moſt ſouls ſtick in the coming off their own bottoms, to be juſtified in Jeſus Chriſt. In a word, Man had rather do any thing, than come a poor deſtitute ſinner to Jeſus Chriſt for all.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Becauſe 'tis not ſuitable to the Light of natural reaſon, that a ſoul ſhould ſatisfie God, or become righteous any other way, than by his own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; to be righteous in another, is of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which till a Soul hath, he cannot let go the principle of ſelf-juſtification.</p>
                        <p>The next thing to be conſidered will be this, if all men are under the Law, and the curſe of it, under the guilt of the whole law, without all excuſe before God, under an impoſſibility of attaining righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or acceptance with God, by the beſt keeping of the Law, and yet a natural and ſtrong aptitude to reſt upon the law, and that a ſoul may reform and take up, be ſtrict in obedience, and yet ſtill be under the law, how then may a ſoul know whether in the way of his Obedience, he be yet under the Law, and not under Grace? Some Diſcoveries I ſhall lay down at
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:172030:49"/>
preſent, reſolving a fuller diſcuſſion of this.</p>
                        <p>And by the way, know and conſider, that though thou art under the the profeſſion of the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and pretendeſt Salvation by him, yet practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and really thou may'ſt be ſtill under the Law.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If thou haſt never been convinc'd of this cloſe evil in thy heart, of reſting on thy praying, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, and endeavouring to keep the Law as well as thou canſt, I ſay, if the Spirit of the Lord hath not convinced thee of it, and of the great danger of it, and ſo humbled thee, and brought thee off it, thou art certainly under the Law as yet.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If thou doſt not <hi>watch againſt</hi> this evil, and doſt not find a great <hi>difficulty,</hi> not to reſt upon a perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any duty to God, thou doſt then certainly <hi>reſt</hi> upon it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If thou art well ſatisfied, that thou art kept from <hi>outward</hi> groſs ſins; and the ſin of thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        <p n="4">4. If thou thinkeſt God will accept of the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed,</hi> if thou doſt as well as thou canſt in every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo as to <hi>accept</hi> thee <hi>thereby,</hi> as if it had been done perfectly; this alſo beſpeaks thee under the Law.</p>
                        <p n="5">5.

                        <p n="6">6. If thou art not troubled about the <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> of thy heart, and not abaſed for it, even in thy beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:172030:50"/>
then thou art yet upon the bottom of the Law, and reſteſt in it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. If thou art not moſtly troubled about <hi>believing,</hi> and doſt not find it the moſt difficult work of thy ſoul, if no complaint to God of an unbelieving heart, then thou art indeed a Hypocrite, and under the Law.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. If thou art not humbled to God for the <hi>ſinful mixtures</hi> of thy duties, the deadneſs, diſtraction of them, and ſo ſeeſt thy acceptance cannot be in them, but in Jeſus Chriſt; then thou reſteſt in them.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. If thou doſt not give up thy ſelf to the <hi>leadings</hi> of the Spirit, and doeſt not find, that in the main of thy courſe, thou art <hi>led</hi> by the Spirit, then thou art under the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. <hi>But if ye are led by the ſpirit, ye are not under the Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. If thou art not troubled about thy <hi>inward growth,</hi> in mortification of all ſin, and more holy Communion with God, then thou art alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law: One under the Law, that is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrict and conſcientious, may grow in the bulk of <hi>outward Duties,</hi> but not in <hi>inward Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. If thy care be not to live in the ſenſe of thy Juſtification by grace through Jeſus Chriſt, and to preſerve the light and peace of a <hi>juſtified ſtate,</hi> which thou haſt been called to by grace; then thou liveſt in ſelf-juſtification.</p>

                        <p>Now the ſoul that hath the bleſſed experience of all theſe, and can ſay, I have through infinite mercy been brought off my own foundation, and I have found the difficulty of it, I find my heart apt to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle upon my own performances, and 'tis that I would watch againſt; and I can experience the ſin of my Nature the greateſt burthen, and cry out of it daily before the Lord; the Hypocriſie of my heart is an abhorring to me, I do find believing the hardeſt work of my ſoul, I do mourn under the ſinful mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of my duties, I do give up my ſelf to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits leadings, I am troubled about my inward growth, and humbled for the ſhortneſs of it, I would learn more and more to live out of my ſelf for my Juſtification, and to be kept a poor empty nothing for ever before the Lord; if this, I ſay, be thy experience, then thou ſhalt have peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; thou may'ſt rejoyce in a juſtified eſtate, Chriſt, his Righteouſneſs, Grace, Spirit, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are thine.</p>
                        <p>Having now laid open the Sinner, as under the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:172030:51"/>
Law, excuſeleſs, guilty and under Condemnation, under an impoſſibility of obtaining righteouſneſs and acceptance with God, by the beſt endeavours to keep the Law; I would now ſet upon the opening the Goſpel-Righteouſneſs by Jeſus Chriſt, through which only a poor condemned Sinner can find acceptance; but that I conceive it firſt needful to ſpeak a word to thoſe words in the cloſe of the 22th. <hi>verſe,</hi> (viz.) <hi>For there is no difference;</hi> which may further help on the conviction we have been upon.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Jew</hi> might object to the Apoſtle thus; you by your Doctrine ſeem to conclude <hi>all</hi> under the Law equally, and under guilt; you make no difference between us <hi>Jews</hi> who have the Law, and endeavour to keep it, and the open prophane Gentiles and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; in this, you do us wrong; No, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>There's no difference,</hi> you who <hi>in part</hi> keep the Law, are under the ſame condemnation as others; that which I ſhall lay down, will be this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obſerv.</hi> There is no difference between the moſt prophane perſon, and the righteous and ſober, as to juſtification or condemnation by the Law.</p>
                        <p>I mean this; the juſt ſober man, as to his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law outwardly or in part, is in as dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable eſtate as the profaneſt wretch in the world: This will hardly go down, but 'tis moſt clear from the Apoſtles words read unto you, and hath been in part proved, by ſhewing all the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Adam,</hi> Jews and Gentiles, ſober and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all under the Law.</p>
                        <p>But a little further to proſecute this Doctrine; for, where a man or woman, who hath lived honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſoberly in the eye of the world (but yet out of Chriſt) convinced that he or ſhe were in as bad and damnable a condition as any great ſinner in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:172030:51"/>
world, it might be a ſtartling to them, and a means, through the Spirit's working, to bring them off their vain confidence, and to lead them to Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Now that I may clear this, let us firſt conſider, what it was that might difference the ſober <hi>Jew</hi> from the prophane idolatrous Gentile; it being the ſame, which, ſuch as conceive themſelves ſober harmleſs people in this day, do put confidence in.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Jew</hi> was <hi>Circumciſed,</hi> which was the firſt Ordinance of the Old Teſtament-Church, as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is of the New, and it doth appear this was much inſiſted on by the <hi>Jew,</hi> by what the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 19. For <hi>he is not a</hi> Jew <hi>who is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh, but he is a</hi> Jew <hi>which is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and Circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. They had the Scriptures of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them were committed the Oracles of God;</hi> which indeed the Apoſtle calls an <hi>Advantage,</hi> (in the ſame place) as it might be a means to lead them to the knowledge of God, and to the Promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, but no advantage at all, (as to the meer having them read and opened, and in a general Faith, believing them) as the more to <hi>juſtifie</hi> them in the ſight of God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Jews were under the <hi>publick Service</hi> of God, ſuch as was ordained by God himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. They were for the moſt part righteous to Men, and ſober, and blameleſs in the outward man; <hi>Ye indeed are they which are righteous before men;</hi> as the Lord often ſpeaks of them: Now 'tis moſt clear, that theſe things did not difference the Jew, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:172030:52"/>
with God and Jeſus Chriſt, from the moſt profane ſinner; for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected theſe, and call'd to himſelf Publicans and Harlots, and tells the Jews that ſuch ſhould <hi>enter into the Kingdom of God before them,</hi> Matth. 21.31. As might be further inſtanc'd in the caſe of the Phariſee and Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9.</p>
                        <p>Now the Reaſons of this point have been before hinted, namely, that a meer ſober Man under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Priviledges, is no more accepted with Chriſt, nor in any nearer capacity to come to Chriſt, than the greateſt ſinner; becauſe one ſin puts a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condemnation of the Law, as well as a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of ſins againſt it; one fellony condemns a man as well as a thouſand, and the Malefactor muſt dye by the Law for it. All the good a man doth, will not be <hi>imputed</hi> to him, if he be found a tranſgreſſor in one part of the Law, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. All men come ſhort of the glory of God, in the fulfilling of the Law, and he that falls ſhort but in one mile is in as bad a caſe as he that falls ſhort twenty miles: Jeſus Chriſt accepts of no man for his righteouſneſs, but as a Sinner, nothing elſe but a Sinner; ſo that ſtill the caſe of a juſt man in reference to the Law, is as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as the greateſt ſinners in the world.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> A little further to preſs this; you who are baptized, have a general belief of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are under part of the publick ſervice of God, are juſt and harmleſs as to men; but yet are under the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of <hi>

                           <pb n="101" facs="tcp:172030:52"/>
between you and the vileſt ſinners in the Country, as to your acceptance with God: Though it be thus with you, yet, as you have been ſhewed, you may be under the Law, condemned for one tranſgreſſion; and what can you be more, than be condemned? Neither doth all this, as in it ſelf, any more prepare you for Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore let all the Convictions, Arguments, Demonſtrations, we have produced from the clear light of the Word of the Lord, at laſt prevail with you, that you who thus <hi>ſatisfie</hi> your ſelves, becauſe you are baptized, believe the Scriptures, frequent the ſervice of God, are juſt and ſober, therefore it is well with you, and you will trouble your ſelves no further in the matter of your Salvation, that the eſtate of your Souls is as unſafe and deſperate, how ſecure ſoever, as the vileſt Drunkard in the Country.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, let this Conviction have force upon your Conſcience, that you muſt come anew to Jeſus Chriſt, as a <hi>meer ſinner,</hi> having nothing to commend you to him.</p>
                        <p>Say, from the Light of the Word, though I have thus ſatisfied my ſelf, pleas'd my ſelf, in theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and outward Priviledges, yet <hi>there's no difference</hi> between me and the vileſt ſinner, in order to my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with Jeſus Chriſt: Nay, if this Conviction take upon thee, thou wilt ſay to the glory of God, and thy own Confuſion; If there be any difference, 'tis that thou art the greateſt ſinner, having mock'd the Lord, reſted in out-ſide ſervice, dealt hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally with the jealous God, offered him abominable ſacrifice, and therefore fit to be abhorred of the Lord for ever: Oh! that this might be the poſture of thy Soul! and ſo thou may'ſt come and lye proſtrate at the feet of Jeſus Chriſt, crying, Oh! no more, no
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:172030:53"/>
more, a righteous perſon! but a ſinner, a guilty ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a condemned ſinner, a poor, blind, naked ſinner; nothing elſe but a ſinner! Away with all my former confidences, tear them from my heart, Lord. Now Lord Jeſus, I caſt my ſelf upon thee! Oh! let me creep unto thy bleſſed feet! Oh! I come to thee; not becauſe I am righteous, (for I would abhor my ſelf for ever in the thought of it) but as a poor periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinner, the worſt of ſinners, an hypocritical ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Oh! that I could take hold of thy <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to cover my naked Soul; I expect it only upon the account of thy <hi>Free-Grace;</hi> Oh Lord, I come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, do not, do not reject me.</p>
                        <p>And thus I have been endeavouring to lay the ſinner before Jeſus Chriſt in ſuch a poſture, having proved him under the Law, excuſeleſs in his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing of it, guilty before God, under an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of reaching to an acceptance with God, by the beſt keeping of the Law; laboured to beat him off ſuch props and confidences that the Heart naturally cleaves to, and ſtript him of all, naked as <hi>Adam,</hi> when he had ſinned before the Lord, as <hi>nothing elſe but a Sinner,</hi> which is that I have driven at. I now come to ſpeak of the way of a poor Souls juſtification, and acceptance with God, by Jeſus Chriſt, as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt, to the capacity of the weakeſt.</p>

                        <p>We have endeavoured, in the former Diſcourſe, to go along with the Apoſtle, in proving, that by all the Deeds of the Law, all the beſt Obedience that a ſinner can reach unto, he cannot be juſtified before
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:172030:54"/>
God, neither in part, nor in whole, that your good deeds will not procure pardon, nor poiſe down your ſins, but all, by the Law, equally under condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Of what importance then is it for poor condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſouls to be well acquainted with, and really and practically inveſted in that way of juſtification, that God in infinite wiſdom, mercy and love, hath ſet forth in the Goſpel, which is that I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtles arguing is thus: If all fall ſhort of righteouſneſs, and acceptance with God, by their own obedience; if all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, then are all, and that equally, condemned: If ſo condemned, then acceptance with God, and juſtification, and remiſſion of ſins, muſt come in another way: The Riſe and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of which, muſt neceſſarily be Gods free mercy and grace: If made righteous, it muſt be in the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of another, wrought forth by <hi>another:</hi> Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied by <hi>another,</hi> a price paid to God for a ſinners redemption by <hi>another,</hi> which is Jeſus Chriſt, bleſſed for ever.</p>
                        <p>From the words then, I ſhall firſt lay down this plain Obſervation, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Obſerv. <hi>Gods free mercy and grace is the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of any ſinners ſalvation;</hi> or, <hi>'Tis upon the account of Gods free grace that any ſinner is ſaved.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus runs the current of the whole Goſpel, the main deſign of the Goſpel being to glorifie the riches of Gods Free-grace by Jeſus Chriſt. Among many other Scriptures the Apoſtle doth moſt convincingly diſcourſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. from the 15th. to the end; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Free-grace of God unto Juſtification, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:172030:54"/>
to a ſinners condemnation; <hi>But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift; for if through the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</hi> To the ſame import runs the reſt of the verſes, <hi>The free gift of many unto Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and the gift of Righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> All of <hi>Grace,</hi> and of <hi>Free-gift, abundance of Grace,</hi> from firſt to laſt; <hi>That as ſin reigned unto death, ſo might Grace reign through Righteouſneſs unto eternal life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> verſe laſt. So the Apoſtle in that Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> wherein the Doctrine of Grace is bleſſedly given forth, drives all the <hi>ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt,</hi> mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to this bleſſed <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> Chap. 2.4. &amp;c. <hi>But God who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins hath quickned us together with Chriſt, (for by Grace ye are ſaved;)</hi> ſo verſe 7. <hi>That in the Ages to come, he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his Grace;</hi> and ver. 8. <hi>For by grace ye are ſaved, it is the gift of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore the invitation of the Goſpel to ſinners runs upon this ſcore; <hi>Ho, Every one that thirſteth, come to the Waters of Life,</hi> Iſa. 55.1. And, <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come to the Water of life freely,</hi> Revel. 22.17.</p>

Sanctification, Perſeverance, Eternal Life and Glory, all flowing from the ſame fountain of Free-grace: Some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Deſign of the Bleſſed God in this, may be gathered from the Scriptures:</p>
                        <p>The Free-grace of God is the Fountain of all, in any ſinners ſalvation;</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe, <hi>There is nothing in the Creature that may move God to ſave him:</hi> Nothing at all, all we know or do, could not move God to mercy, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, becauſe you were more in number than any people, but becauſe he freely loved you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Not for your ſake do I do this,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.32.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As God ſaw nothing in him, ſo the ſinner is <hi>able to bring nothing to God,</hi> to draw out mercy of his own, therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. let him come without his price: As the ſinner loſt all his good, ſo he can procure none anew to bring to God, that may in the leaſt move the heart of God to give out more to him.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If it were not all of Grace, <hi>then the Creature would have occaſion of boaſting;</hi> but the Lord in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom, ſo laid the Project of a ſinners Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no Creature ſhould have the leaſt ground of boaſting: So the Apoſtle having given out the Doctrine of Grace in this Scripture we are upon, draws this concluſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded,</hi> &amp;c. So in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29. the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt lays down this as the main ſcope of God in the Goſpel: That, <hi>No fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence,</hi> Therefore Salvation is all of Grace, of Free-grace.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="107" facs="tcp:172030:55"/>4. If it were not ſo, <hi>The glory of God would not be ſo great in the Salvation of a ſinner.</hi> 'Tis now ſo laid, that all might be, <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his Grace,</hi> Epheſ. 1.6. It being the higheſt piece of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Wiſe and Bleſſed God did ever deſign unto himſelf, that his free, rich, abundant, infinite grace might be made known in the Salvation of a Sinner: <hi>That he might make known the riches of his glory on the Veſſels of Mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</hi> Rom. 9.23.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If God's Free-grace be the Fountain of all in a poor Sinners Salvation, then let it eſtabliſh our judgments in this Doctrine: Therefore God had no reſpect to any fore-ſight of Faith or Works in the Creature; God had no reſpect to the freeneſs of his Will, for he knew he had none: God had no reſpect to any conditions to be wrought in us; but all he did, and doth, was from abſolute Independing Grace: Nothing moved him but his own Free-grace. The ſame Free-grace that pardons, <hi>gives</hi> and <hi>works,</hi> all in us; all from the ſame Fountain.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If all be of Free-grace, then there is no <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious procuring</hi> Cauſe in us, that <hi>moves</hi> the Lord to mercy: Now the contrary is naturally rooted in our hearts, poor Souls are moſt apt to conceive, that if they can grieve for their ſins, repent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, this will ſure <hi>move</hi> God to mercy and pardon. A moſt dangerous ſnare, from which a Soul, after much conviction, is hardly wrought off: Now, though God in the way of a ſinners Salvation, hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give Repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. and a <hi>Spirit of mourning for ſin:</hi> Yet a poor ſoul muſt take heed that he make not this a <hi>procuring</hi> cauſe of Pardon:

Many a Soul ſticks here, before <hi>emptied</hi> of himſelf, even of his very repenting, and ſo come for grace and mercy, upon the account of the Free-promiſe only: How many a Sinner might have been ſaved, if he would have been ſaved <hi>freely?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. If God hath ſo laid the Deſign to ſave a Sinner freely, then how great, how juſt is the Condemnation of guilty ſinners, that will not haſten in unto it; how could the Lord have laid it more <hi>freely</hi> than he hath? Oh that any ſinner, for ever condemned to Hell without it, ſhould withſtand it! Why ſinner? Shall the bleſſed God, that might have much glory in condemning thee to all Eternity, be willing to ſave thee freely; and wilt thou not come and bow unto him, and accept of it? All the contempt of God in all his holy Commands, is not like this, to turn the back upon <hi>Free</hi>-Mercy, <hi>Free</hi>-Salvation: This will be the Worm that never dies, to any of your Souls that ſhall not come into, and rightly accept of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Salvation, that you might have been ſaved free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have had grace, remiſſion of ſins, Jeſus Chriſt, the Spirit, Eternal Life freely, and yet turned your backs upon it? But you may demand, How is it that any ſinner doth ſo? What is it that cauſeth any Soul to forego Free-grace and Mercy, when held out unto him, that we may beware of ſuch hinderances?</p>
                        <p>I will therefore ſhew you ſuch Hinderances, that keep Souls from accepting of God's Free-grace in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, when held out unto them.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Wilful Obſtinacy,</hi> Joh. 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that you might have life: Ye will not;</hi> ſuch is the ſtubborneſs and rebellion of the heart of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he will not, as we ſpeak, becauſe he will not; to ſuch a height hath ſin raiſed the heart of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:172030:56"/>
children of men; for every natural man, till made ſenſible of unbelief, thinks he hath power of himſelf, (though he hath not) but his Rebellion lies in his Will: <hi>I would have gathered you, and you would not,</hi> Mat. 33. laſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A ſinner doth not accept of Free-grace, <hi>becauſe he ſtands upon his ſelf-juſtification;</hi> he will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded he hath ſo much need of all Free-grace, as the Goſpel diſcovers; as hath been ſhewed at large, though he hath ſinned, yet alſo he hath obeyed, and ſo he puts one againſt the other, his obedience againſt his ſin, and ſo hopes to get that mercy he hath need of. And upon this ground, more ſinners, even that profeſs the Name of God, do miſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, than any other in the World: 'Tis not ſo eaſie a matter to ſubmit to God's Free-grace alone, as many do imagine: Upon this Snare, many of the Jewiſh Profeſſors of Chriſt fell ſhort, as 'tis clear from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and did fruſtrate the grace of God.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A Sinner hath a ſecret thought of <hi>making God ſatisfaction,</hi> by his ſorrow and amendment, and ſo makes void the Free-grace of God: 'Tis the eaſieſt thing in the World to put up legal ſorrow, and amendment of life to God, as that which may make God amends; yea, to make an <hi>attonement</hi> of every Duty, which is the cloſeſt and moſt deſperate evil of the heart: So did the Jew by his ſacrifices and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which cauſed the Lord to pronounce them, <hi>That his ſoul loathed them,</hi> Iſa. 1.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A Sinner doth not ſavingly cloſe with free grace, <hi>from ſecret pride of heart,</hi> he would not be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:172030:57"/>
found ſo poor and helpleſs, ſo unrighteous and ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as to be beholden to free mercy for all; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons will rather ſtarve than beg, than live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another mans mercy: 'Tis ſo between a ſinner and the Lord, till God humble him, he'd rather venture Hell, than come and acknowledge utter Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing but ſin upon him, and ſo ſtoop to free mercy.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The ſinner ſtands off from Free-grace, <hi>becauſe he will make his own terms:</hi> He will <hi>condition</hi> for his carnal caſe, his ſelf-intereſt, his boſom luſt, the love of the World, and hopes God will allow him his terms, which he propoſeth to himſelf; and herein he is ruined. Now God hath drawn up the tenour of his free-grace in the way of a Covenant, and though there are no conditions left to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make good on his part, by his own power, (for that will eaſily imply a ſelf-ſufficiency in him, and is abſolutely derogatory from the grace of God in the Goſpel-Covenant) yet God hath drawn up (as I may ſo ſpeak) what other good things he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on the ſubjects of his free-grace, Namely, The Law to be new written in their hearts, the gift of the Spirit, Newneſs of heart, with the making good of all thoſe promiſes, in a degree, that hold forth Holineſs and new Obedience, which muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the free pardon of ſins, and make indeed the free grace of God more glorious: Inaſmuch as when he pardons them he will ſave them from the ſervice of ſin, work his Image upon them, bring them to a bleſſed conformity to himſelf, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd aright, ſweetens and heightens the free-grace of God, and makes the terms of it more bleſſed. In a word, Mercy and Holineſs muſt go together, a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:172030:57"/>
and Sanctifier, which a ſinner from the curſed love of eaſe and ſatisfaction to his luſt ſticks at, and ſo comes not up to Gods terms, (which are bleſſed and holy) and ſo miſſeth of grace and mercy for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe he chooſeth Sin rather than Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Yea, a ſinner (and I ſpeak all this while of ſuch as pretend to an intereſt in free mercy) miſſeth of this grace, <hi>becauſe he takes up the terms of God in his Covenant-grace in his own ſtrength,</hi> will repent and come up to new obedience before he comes to the promiſe, to the free grace of God for it; which is alſo a dangerous ſnare. A Sinners firſt work (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced as we have opened) is to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the free grace of God for all, to give all, to work all, and to follow God by vertue of Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of ſuch good and Grace as the tenour of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant holds forth: 'Tis an uſual thing for poor Souls firſt to think to convert themſelves, make themſelves holy, and then come to God, and Jeſus Chriſt, this is an indirect courſe, Oh! a poor Soul muſt begin at the Foundation of Gods free Grace, for Chriſt, for Pardon, for the Spirit, for Converſion, for Holineſs, for all, as held out in Promiſes, and then the work will be ſure, and proſper, and nought ſhall hinder it.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Sinners fail of this free Grace of God, from a neglect and a ſleighting of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How ſhall you eſcape, if you neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Sinners do hear that, though they are ſinners and condemned, in a damnable eſtate, yet Jeſus Chriſt will ſave them; if they will come unto him, ſit them for Heaven, and do it himſelf for them, and in them; yet
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:172030:58"/>
through a deſperate folly, ſecurity and careleſs tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the heart being in a dead ſleep, they wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect it.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. From the power of Unbelief, which they are under, and ſee it not.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I ſhewed thoſe ſpecial hindrances that cauſe poor Souls that hear of Goſpel-grace to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and for ever to miſs of it.</p>
                        <p>Oh that this word of the Lord might find you out, and might be as a glaſs to ſhew you your own hearts; you who by a wilful obſtinacy have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Goſpel-calls hitherto, Oh, now fall down before the Lord, and cry, I yield, I yield, thou bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>God,</hi> thy Patience, thy freeſt Grace hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me; Lord, take away a rebellious obſtinate heart from me! Ah Lord! Thou haſt waited to be gracious, and Chriſt, and Mercy, and Heaven have been offered to ſo vile a Wretch freely: Now, Lord, I throw my ſelf at thy feet, a thouſand Hells are too good for me: But if grace, infinite grace, be free, there's yet hope for me. If there be not grace enough in Heaven for me, let me go to the depth of Hell But Lord, I take hold of thee, I deſire to do it Oh, do thou take hold of me, and I ſhall not periſh.</p>
                        <p>You who have ſtood upon your terms, and hoped you had righteouſneſs enough to cover you, and <hi>God</hi> would look upon that, and not upon your ſin, you are the moſt abominable in God's ſight: You, who ſecretly in your hearts think your ſorrowing and reforming, makes God amends: You who have wrapt your ſelves in theſe Cobwebs, and through pride of heart, will not lay them down; Oh, if thou wilt have mercy, thou muſt have all in a way of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:172030:58"/>
mercy and grace, all freely, or nothing at all; ſee all thy righteouſneſs made void by one ſin againſt the Law, and therefore curſed and condemned by it; therefore thou haſt no Plea but free mercy and grace: Oh lay down all thy other Pleas, they will never be heard in Heaven! and now cry out, Oh 'tis of grace! Proud ſelfiſh Wretch that I have been; 'tis all of free grace, if ever I am ſaved: If God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pardon freely, beſtow Jeſus Chriſt freely, I am undone for ever: Oh the wicked caſtings of my heart this way and that way! Oh there's nothing, nothing but infinite miſery to move mercy! All my goodneſs is an accurſed thing as from my ſelf: There's an infinite Fountain of ſin and ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in men: Oh could I come to an infinite Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of grace! Thus thou wilt come to God, when he ſhall ſmite thy heart, which now look up unto him to do.</p>
                        <p>You who have been making your own terms of eaſe, and luſts, and world: Oh render up your hearts to the gracious, bleſſed, holy terms, that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth: Why ſhouldſt thou not be willing to be made holy? Why ſhould not the Lord rather rule thee than ſin and the Devil? What more beautiful and glorious than the Image of God? Oh accept of Holineſs with Mercy, through the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt! Come unto him for both; be willing to be ſet apart for God, a Veſſel purged and ſanctified for his uſe, and thou ſhalt behold the face of God ſhining upon thee; and whatever is laid up in Chriſt, in Promiſes, in Heaven and Glory, ſhall be thine.</p>
                        <p>You who have thought to make your ſelves holy, and then come to Chriſt to be juſtified; be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of your great Error, and now come as <hi>ſinners</hi> to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:172030:59"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, to be juſtified and ſanctified in him, and ſee all grace laid up in Jeſus Chriſt for ſuch as come unto him. Say, Oh bleſſed Lord Jeſus, I cannot fit my ſelf for thee! If thou canſt not accept me as a poor undone helpleſs ſinner, coming unto thee, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect a bleſſing from thee.</p>
                        <p>And you who have ſleighted this free, rich and glorious grace, ſee what you have done, and be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for it; ſee how you caſt back mercy upon the face of God, who would freely be reconciled with you, paſs by all the grievous injuries you have done him, enter into a Covenant with you, beſtow his Chriſt upon you, fit you for communion with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf here and for ever: And all this you have ſleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet muſt unavoidably be for ever damned without it. Sinner, who can plead for thee, when thou ſhalt go on to deſpiſe, neglect, ſlight ſuch grace? To Hell, without pity of God, Angels or Men, when freeſt mercy and grace ſhall be ſlighted.</p>
                        <p>I do therefore ſtand this day in the Name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to acquaint you, that he will ſave you freely, if you will come unto him, be your ſins what they will, ſo you come not as righteous, but as ſinners to him; ſo you take his Righteouſneſs to cover you, and his Spirit of grace to unite you to him, and make you holy, and will give up your ſelves unto him: All which he will help, if you will come and cry to him, yea, if you cannot come, he will draw you; if you are unwilling, he will make you willing, if you have no heart, he will <hi>give you heart:</hi> What more?

Will not your hearts ſtir? dead, ſtupid Souls! Shall God's Free-grace, his Chriſt, go a begging this day, and will not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come up to his terms? Old ſinners, that are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the grave, and Hell too, will not you accept of Free-grace, of Chriſt, the Spirit, this day? that are upon the brink of the grave and everlaſting burnings, and have many a thouſand ſins yet unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned? Is all this nothing to you? but reſt in a blind hope of mercy, without coming to Jeſus Chriſt, without care of being made holy, and fit for Heaven: Oh, you have been faſt aſleep in ſin, deceived by your own hearts, abuſed by the Devil, forty, fifty, ſixty years, Is't not time for you to bethink your ſelves, to go and cry to the Bleſſed God; Oh, Grace, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Chriſt, Heaven, upon any Terms! My righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs I have truſted in are poor Cobwebs, my Confidences vain; Oh, for a drop of Free-mercy and grace, from that Ocean that is in God, and 'twere better than all I have done for Heaven yet: Oh Lord! Now, now I come to thee: Is there free-mercy and grace for one that hath ſlighted it? Yea, though thou haſt gone on frowardly in thy own heart, yet he can heal thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17, 18.</p>
                        <p>And you that are younger, 'tis a deſperate thing now in times of Goſpel-Light, when it glares upon your faces, to ſhut your eyes, to go on in the way of your own hearts, to ſlight Goſpel-Grace, to harden your ſelves, and cry, hereafter, hereafter. Alas! thou knoweſt not what ſhall be on the morrow; the Thread of thy life is quickly cut with a ſtroak from God. Beſide, to go on long, from year to year, againſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:172030:60"/>
the loud and frequent Call of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt Convictions, that thou ſhouldſt do otherwiſe, is the way to be given up to utter hardneſs, and the Lord to move upon thy heart no more. There's a day of grace to every Soul, which if he ſuffer to ſet and go down upon him, he is irrecoverably loſt for ever: Look to it, you younger men and maidens, that have yet no work upon you; that are the ſame you were, under the means you have lived; that have not the Spirit of grace and mourning upon you, when others are praying and wreſtling with the Lord, and taking the Kingdom of Heaven by violence. Oh up, and be ſtirring, the day of grace hath ſhined long upon you: Hold out no longer, <hi>Come, Come, Come,</hi> you careleſs Sons and Daughters, and the way is open to you: The door of Free-grace is open, Chriſts Arms are open; you may be ſaved and bleſſed for ever, if you come in, now you are invited; I can take no excuſe: <hi>Come,</hi> or ſay, I am reſolved for Hell, and to venture the utmoſt in the condition I am in: Oh, bold and fearleſs Atheiſm! What ſhall I ſay to thee, if that be thy Reſolution? But I cannot be ſo anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Say, you Sinners, as if I ſhould name you; are you for Heaven, or Hell; for Free-grace, or your own patch'd-up righteouſneſs; for carnal eaſe, or any Pains for Heaven; for your Luſts, or for Holineſs; for Jeſus Chriſt, or the Devil? let thy heart anſwer in good earneſt this day.</p>
                        <p>Now ſhall I at leaſt have this Anſwer: Hold! I am reſolved for the Free-grace of God, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; If all the ſinners in the Congregation, yea, in the World, ſhould turn their backs upon him; The Word of the Lord hath overcome, Oh Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, may I come? ſuch a Wretch as I come? Yea, ſaith the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:172030:60"/>
him come.</hi> Grace is as free as ever it was: Say then, Oh Lord, I come; draw me, and I will come: Into the Arms of Free-grace I throw my ſelf, my Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is an abominable thing: Ah! a Chriſt upon any terms; Oh let, let me creep unto thy Bleſſed Feet; let me have the loweſt Room in thy Heart: Take what way thou wilt to purge me, ſo I may but get well unto thee. Now Lord, as much Holineſs as thou wilt, let thy precious blood waſh me all over. Well, go thus, and acquaint the Lord Jeſus with it from day to day; wait, he will ſpeak to thee, love to hear more from him, and of him in his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and thou biddeſt fair for Heaven; yea, there will preſently be joy in Heaven for thee.</p>
                        <p>In a word, I proteſt againſt you in the Name and Authority of God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath ſent me, if you ſhall withſtand the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, freely, moſt freely offered you, I ſhall be a Witneſs againſt you: And if any ſinners in the World ſhall be certainly damned, you are they, who neglect this great Salvation: 'Tis come to this, I would, ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, and ye will not. What ado to have a ſinner that's ſinking to Hell, to come to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be freely ſaved? What ſhould a guilty ſinner do, but come to a free Saviour to be ſaved, and accept of his terms (which are ſo bleſſed) with a thouſand hearts if he had them? Now ſay, how am I ſtraightned, till I get to him; I would go and weep my heart out to him, had I a heart to do it.</p>
                        <p>Now I leave what hath been ſpoken to the good pleaſure of God, and the work of his Power, who is able to ſend away every Soul trembling and reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up themſelves to him.</p>
                        <p>Only a word to any poor humbled doubting
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:172030:61"/>
ſoul, that thinks infinitely well of all this, but ſaith in his heart, all this grace is too good for me, I have ſinned againſt it, and ſlighted it; I fear, whether ever I may be accepted. Oh remember, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that <hi>Grace</hi> were not <hi>Grace,</hi> if 'twere not free; God can ſave a ſinner <hi>freely;</hi> that's enough to ſtay thee; yea, though thou haſt ſlighted grace, (as where is the Saint but did ſo, before effectually called?) yea God <hi>will</hi> ſave a ſinner freely, that will come by Jeſus Chriſt unto him. <hi>He will:</hi> What would'ſt have more? Do not ſtand reaſoning thus; but, if thou art a ſinner, undone without him, caſt off from thy own Confidences, go to him in the Name of God, and believe him upon his own Word: Say, I take thee, Bleſſed Lord, upon thy own Word; thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come:</hi> And Lord, therefore I come; I durſt not come, were I not invited freely; and if I muſt be ſaved freely, if ever, then thou art to beſtow all, work all, begin and perfect all; Oh bleſſed Lord, I come unto thee for it; go and do thus, and thou ſhalt be comforted, and rejoice in his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>I might alſo here preſs bleſſed Souls, who have been drawn to Jeſus Chriſt, and overcome by Free-grace to do it, to live in the Admiration of that grace, and to be low, and poor, and emptied in your ſelves, in the abundant ſenſe of it all your days. Let your enjoyments and attainments be what they will, be it known unto you, that by grace ye are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and you had, and have as much need of it, as any ſinner in the World. God's Deſign in ſaving you, was to glorifie Grace, and it muſt be your Deſign alſo here, and for ever.</p>
                        <p>Having thus opened, in ſome meaſure, the grace of God, to be the Fountain of a ſinner's Salvation, I
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:172030:61"/>
ſhall now proceed to diſcover the way of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of this grace, which is by Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>(Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified freely by his grace, through the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Jeſus Chriſt.)</hi> Though God reſolved to beſtow grace upon ſuch as ſhall be ſaved freely, yet in a way of his own moſt wiſe and bleſſed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning, by his Eternal Son Jeſus Chriſt, to whom this Diſpenſation of Grace was committed; which I ſhall further open in this Doctrine: Namely,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Doct.</hi> All that Grace and Mercy which <hi>GOD</hi> gives out freely to ſinners, is conveyed to them by his Eternal Son, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>I might be abundant in the proof of this: See in that 5th. of the <hi>Rom. v.</hi> 17, 21. — <hi>Much more they which receive abundance of Grace, and of the gift of Righteouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And verſ. 21. <hi>That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might Grace through Righteouſneſs unto Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> All the Grace that ſhould reign unto Life is given out by one <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. The Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1.17. All the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Grace were laid up in him; and therefore he ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>All things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto me of my Father, and none can come unto the Father but by me;</hi> which he makes as the great Argument why ſinners ſhould come unto him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. Now, ſo far as the Lord hath revealed the wiſe and holy Counſels of his heart in his Word unto us, let us enquire into the Reaſons why he took ſuch a way to give all his grace to the children of men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. The firſt is this, That as Mankind loſt all in the Fall of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as he was a publick
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:172030:62"/>
perſon, repreſenting all that came of him: So it was the Wiſdom of God in the recovery of loſt-man to bring forth another perſon, that ſhould be fully ſtockt with Grace and Righteouſneſs, as a publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repreſent all the Elect unto the Father; upon which account Jeſus Chriſt is called the <hi>Second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. And the Apoſtle ſets the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in his offence unto Death, and the Grace and Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> one againſt the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 16, &amp;c. <hi>For as by one mans Diſobedience many were made ſinners; ſo by the Obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous:</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle ſets the Life, Grace, Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, as the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> againſt the Death, Condemnation, Diſobedience of the firſt man that ſinned in the ſeven laſt Verſes of that Chapter. And herein the Wiſdom of the Father is moſt excellently ſet forth, and the ground of Conſolation to Believers laid upon a moſt ſure Foundation: That whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they loſt in the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> they recover with <hi>much more</hi> abundance in Jeſus Chriſt; for ſo the Apoſtle hath [that <hi>much more</hi>] in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentioned, three or four times; that Saints may ſee how abundantly compleat they are in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. All Grace is conveyed by Jeſus Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there needed a perſon to ſtand between GOD and Sinners, as a <hi>Mediator</hi> to work forth Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between them. Now who was meet but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to undertake this? He being the Eternal Son of God, equal with God, was near unto God. A meer creature was infinitely unfit for ſuch an undertaking, and he being alſo the Son of man, cloathed in the nature of man; he thus partaking of the nature of God, who was to be appeaſed; and of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:172030:62"/>
the nature of Man, who was to be reconciled, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a moſt meet Undertaker of ſo glorious a <hi>Work;</hi> Whence he hath that bleſſed Title given him of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: Jeſus the Mediator of a New Covenant,</hi> Heb. 12.24. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. God reſolved that his bleſſed Son Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have the <hi>Honour</hi> in this bleſſed Tranſaction, to convey his Grace to loſt Sinners, <hi>James</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son:</hi> So the Apoſtle fully, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>All things were for him:</hi> And <hi>that in all things he might have the preheminence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For by him, and to him, and for him are all things.</hi> This Honour the Father committed to the Son, to bring about this great Contrivance of bringing Man back again unto God.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. God letting out his Grace by Jeſus Chriſt, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his love more <hi>abundant</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> to poor Sinners, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. So loved it, that he could not give forth a greater manifeſtation of his love. Now the Father purpoſed to render his love to ſinners, by the gift of his Son, moſt full and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; and therefore gave him out of his Boſom, and all the Riches of his Love and Grace by him.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. This way of the Father's Diſpenſation of Grace by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, hath rendered the Grace of God moſt <hi>ſure and unchangeable</hi> to his own. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace being now eſtabliſhed between the Father and Jeſus Chriſt; Jeſus Chriſt being the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker in it for all the Father gave him, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly founded upon a ſure Bottom: This was the Fathers Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. — <hi>I will give him for a Covenant to the People.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, as a common
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:172030:63"/>
perſon, did repreſent all the Elect in the Covenant, as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt Covenant did repreſent all his; and Jeſus Chriſt did undertake to bring them to God, to bring them into the Covenant, and ſo to eſtate them in all the grace, and Mercy, and Bleſſing of it; Therefore the Mercies of the Covenant are ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The ſure mercies of David,</hi> Iſa, 55.3. As a Type of Jeſus Chriſt, coming of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is ſet forth the excellency of the New Covenant, the whole Tranſaction of it entruſted in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore not one drop of the Mercy of it, can ever fail thoſe that are taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. By the giving forth of Jeſus Chriſt, the whole of Goſpel-Salvation is rendered more glorious: The Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holineſs of God, as well as Mercy and Love, do ſhine forth in Jeſus Chriſt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel-Myſtery is ſtyled, <hi>The manifold Wiſdom of God,</hi> Epheſ. 3.10. Every Attribute of God is glorified in the giving out of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Yea, had not God taken this way of making out himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, the world had dwelt in groſs darkneſs of him; therefore Jeſus Chriſt is ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Image of the Inviſible God,</hi> Col. 1.15. <hi>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of the Father; The brightneſs of his glory,</hi> Heb. 1.

                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. There could not have been acceſs to <hi>God,</hi> but by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt; for through him we both have acceſs by one

                        <p n="9">9. Had <hi>God</hi> let forth Mercy to Sinners, and not given out his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, his juſtice muſt have been violated,</hi> which is the main of all.

                        <p n="10">10. The bleſſed <hi>God</hi> took this way of letting out himſelf, his Grace, by Jeſus Chriſt, that thereby <hi>Saints might have <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with him,</hi> which was a holy Deſign of the Father in ſaving them; — <hi>That they may be one in us,</hi> John 17.21. The deepeſt and moſt unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Myſtery in our Salvation: Now Jeſus Chriſt, as the Eternal Son of <hi>God,</hi> taking upon him our natures, we became capable of being united to him, through the Spirit, and made one with the humane nature of Chriſt, whereby we are alſo united to the <hi>God-head,</hi> and ſo become one with the Father and the Son, which is the top of the Saints perfection.</p>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:172030:64"/>
us with this rich and glorious Myſtery, as it is ſtyled, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. Namely, <hi>God reconciling the world by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> letting forth the knowledge of himſelf, glorifying all his Attributes, making ſuch diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Glory, providing ſuch a way of Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch a glorious Mediator, laying the bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a ſinners glorious Salvation ſo ſure, rendring his love ſo acceptable and glorious, making way for free acceſs unto himſelf, and how we might become one with him: Oh! the depths of the Wiſdom and Love of God; which of them may we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire moſt? Well may Angels pry into this Holy Myſtery, well may it be the aſtoniſhment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, of the whole Creation: How much more of a ſinner, for whoſe ſake it was thus ordered! Oh, that we might fall upon our faces, and adore the Wiſdom and Grace of God, in ſuch a contrivance as this, Oh, unmeaſurable Goodneſs! unfathomed Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! Eternity is but enough to admire it! To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God in Chriſt, will be the viſion which the ſouls of bleſſed Saints will be wrapt up into, to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Oh! therefore what infinite Mercy is it to be brought forth in the New-Teſtament-times, when the Myſtery hid in God, hid from ages, <hi>kept ſecret ſince the world began,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.25. is brought to light, and ſparkling upon the darkneſs of the world; when the glory of God is riſen upon the World: Now if <hi>this Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3. Wo unto them that cloſe their eyes, when the light ſhines round about them; Oh, you that yet ſit in darkneſs, and the ſhadow of death, Ariſe, Awake, look up, that Goſpel-light may ſhine into you; Oh cry, and wait that your eyes may be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to behold God coming forth, in the Revelation of

Jeſus Chriſt in the glorious Goſpel, wait for the Spirit, and that the Goſpel in the preaching of it may become <hi>the miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8. Oh guilty world, that ſo ſlight the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and contemn the Miniſtration of it; wo unto them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If God doth let forth no Grace and Mercy, but by Jeſus Chriſt, it may ſerve to <hi>unbottom poor ſouls</hi> from a general carnal hope of Mercy, not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the way of Grace by Jeſus Chriſt, nor coming as loſt ſinners in themſelves to be found in Chriſt, and juſtified by Jeſus Chriſt; this they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly neglect, having an empty notion of Chriſt's dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but know not for what; and upon what grounds and how a ſinner gets to God by him; Oh! let this reprove you for this groſs and damnable neglect, and convince you that all your pretended hopes of Mercy will vaniſh, unleſs you learn the Knowledge of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. And therefore, If no way to the Father, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Mercy, no acceſs to God? but by Jeſus Chriſt, let it ſerve to teach poor ignorant ſinners, yea all of us, how to get to God, to Mercy, into his Covenant; Oh! No way but by Jeſus Chriſt; Oh! I can never come to the preſence of God's Majeſty, but by Jeſus Chriſt, who is appointed Mediator to bring a poor ſinner to himſelf, to make way for him into the preſence of God, to conveigh Mercy and Grace to a poor ſinner; Oh, ſay, that I could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint my ſelf with Jeſus Chriſt, take hold of his skirts, and he will bring me into the favour, love, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, viſion, union of God; this is the <hi>way</hi> for a ſinner to come unto him, <hi>John</hi> 14.6.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Let it call upon Saints that know Jeſus Chriſt in the Spirit, that they do not grow <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to him,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:172030:65"/>
that they <hi>neglect</hi> not Jeſus Chriſt: Oh! Neglect him not in his bleſſed Mediation, Grace, Love, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, Appearance, Ordinances: 'Tis a grievous thing, and very apt are Saints to it, to neglect Jeſus Chriſt; Oh! ſtill know and conſider, that as your acceſs to God was by him at firſt, ſo it is ſtill; His Mediation for you, his love and grace, and fellowſhip, is as good as ever, as precious as it ever was; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have high and precious thoughts of him, of your bleſſed acceſs to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>The next thing that I come to open is, how Jeſus Chriſt wrought forth Salvation and Juſtification for a Sinner, ſo that the free grace of God might by him be freely let out upon a ſinner, namely, the work of his <hi>Redemption, [through the Redemption that is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,]</hi> verſe 24.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon the many difficulties that the wiſdom of the fleſh hath ſtarted about the <hi>word</hi> or <hi>work</hi> of our Redemption, but endeavour, as I have promiſed, to give it out in a plain, Scriptural, practical manner, for the uſe of poor ſinners.</p>
                        <p>Redemption ſignifies a deliverance from Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by a price or ranſom laid down.</p>
                        <p>Man had ſinn'd himſelf into captivity, and a juſt condemnation; God from his own free Mercy, was willing he ſhould be ſet at Liberty, but this ſhould not be done but by a <hi>price</hi> or <hi>ranſom</hi> being paid to God, which was the intervening <hi>death</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, who being the eternal Son of God, came down from Heaven, took upon him the nature of man, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtand in the room of ſinners, bearing their ſins, in the undergoing the puniſhment for them, whereby God <hi>laid upon</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Iniquities of all</hi> that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. proceeded againſt him as if he had been the ſinner, in a way of Juſtice,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:172030:65"/>
executed his wrath upon him; Thus he is ſaid to dye <hi>for</hi> the ſins of his own, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. and to give himſelf <hi>for us,</hi> and to give his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom <hi>for</hi> many, which death of Jeſus Chriſt is ſtyled an <hi>expiatory Sacrifice, an attonement and Propitiation,</hi> all which, do imply, that by the death of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> was made to the infinite Juſtice of God, as if the ſinners that are ſaved by it, had ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the utmoſt of Divine Juſtice in their own perſons; Thus much may ſerve briefly, to open the nature of Chriſt's Redemption.</p>
                        <p>The Doctrine I ſhall lay down from the words will be this.</p>
                        <p>Doct. <hi>To the Salvation and Juſtification of a ſinner, (in order to God's letting out his free grace upon him) there was required the death of Jeſus Chriſt, as a price laid down to the juſtice of God for his Redemption.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I might urge many more Texts beſides what have been named, As 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. — <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed not with ſilver and gold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 1.7. Col. 1.14. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of our ſins:</hi> This was it which was typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by all the Sacrifices in the Old-Teſtament-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, as in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> at large; eſpecially in the 9th. Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 22. — <hi>And almoſt all things are by the Law purged with blood, and without ſhedding of blood is no remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From hence the Reaſons of Divine Wiſdom, thus proceeding, ſo far as revealed in the Word, will be clear.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. That the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God might be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:172030:66"/>
in the Salvation of ſinners, as well as <hi>Mercy.</hi> Now there being <hi>attonement</hi> made to <hi>Juſtice</hi> by the <hi>death</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs of God hath a ſhare in the glory of mans Salvation, with the Grace and Mercy of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> of God's juſtice did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, which being violated by the ſin of Man, it was moſt equal that ſatisfaction be made, which no meer creature was able to do; and therefore the eternal Son of God, bleſſed for ever, was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Father to it: Therefore 'tis ſaid <hi>verſe</hi> 25. of this third of the <hi>Romans. — That he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of them that believe in Jeſus;</hi> given as a reaſon of God's ſetting forth his Son to be a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. The expreſs word of the Lord did require it, who <hi>pronounced</hi> to all mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> that the tranſgreſſor ſhould <hi>ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 2.17. Therefore upon his tranſgreſſion, the ſinner muſt either die in his own perſon, or another in his ſtead, which God in his infinite wiſdom might order as he pleas'd; Now God being willing to glorifie his mercy, choſe to lay this puniſhment on his own Son Jeſus Chriſt, and not on the condemned Sinner, which Jeſus Chriſt alſo voluntarily undertaking, the word of the Lord was fully made good, and Jeſus Chriſt dying for the ſinner, (being made a curſe for him) 'twas all one as if the ſinner himſelf had died.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. God gave out a holy and righteous Law, written in the heart of <hi>Adam;</hi> which Law was <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> Rom. 7. Now this Law being broken, God would not diſpence with it, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to the ſinner, unleſs his Law was <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt undertook, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:172030:66"/>
through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfill'd in us,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 4.4. <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Law was fulfilled by Jeſus Chriſt, as if the ſinner had kept it fully in his own perſon, by Chriſt's becoming <hi>obedient</hi> to the death of the Croſs, and ſo ſuffering the puniſhment of the Law, (ſtill in the ſtead and name of the ſinner) and by his keeping the Law, in the pure original righteouſneſs of his nature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26, 27. and by his actual obedience to it, in the <hi>perfect</hi> obſerving of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>For as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one many were made righteous:</hi> Namely, by the <hi>obedience</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, which he gave unto the Law: Now all ſinners being condemned by the Law, the Law could not remit them, till it was ſatisfied, it call'd for <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and full <hi>obedience,</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt gave unto it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. God could not ſo <hi>freely</hi> (to ſpeak after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men) let out grace and mercy, unleſs ſuch ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction had been given by Jeſus Chriſt: Now it can come eaſily, delightfully, chearfully from the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and gracious God, ſeeing his juſtice will not plead againſt it, but for it, being bleſſedly ſatisfied, and Jeſus Chriſt by his death did fully <hi>merit</hi> it and <hi>deſerve</hi> it at the hands of God, and laid down as much as God in infinite juſtice would require, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis now as well <hi>juſtice</hi> as <hi>mercy,</hi> for God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Sinner that comes to God by Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>God is juſt to forgive us our ſins.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, hereupon, God having <hi>ordained</hi> and <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
                           <pb n="130" facs="tcp:172030:67"/>
of ſuch a way of <hi>attonement,</hi> his juſtice glorified and ſatisfied, his word (that the ſinner ſhould die) made good, his Law to the utmoſt ſatisfied; what remains, but that the bleſſed God can <hi>remit</hi> the <hi>bondage, guilt, condemnation</hi> of the ſinner, having thus accepted of ſatisfaction? what remains, but that he ſhould pronounce, as he doth, <hi>Job</hi> 33.24. <hi>Deliver him, for I have found a Ranſom;</hi> God can now pardon the ſinner that comes believingly by Jeſus Chriſt to him for it, without any regret, his juſtice ſhall be glorified by it, as well as his mercy; God hath charg'd all upon another, and accepted of full payment, call'd himſelf to witneſs of it, and will never repent of it.</p>

                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p n="2">2. 'Twas infinite grace towards the ſinner, <hi>to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſatisfaction by a ſurety,</hi> Heb. 5. and not on the ſinner, the party offending, himſelf; what abundant grace and love, to lay the ſins and guilt upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially the only Son of his boſom, who was without all ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.21. and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the poor helpleſs ſinner for ever.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. 'Twas infinite free grace, for <hi>God himſelf to contrive the way of ſuch a Redemption:</hi> Had it been left to ſinful man to have found out a way, how juſtice might be ſatisfied, he could never have done it: It

could never have entred into the heart of Man or Angels, to have offered to God a ſatisfactory way for the making up of his wronged juſtice, but he muſt have periſhed for ever.</p>
                        <p n="4">4.

If then Salvation and remiſſion of ſins came in this way, by the death and blood of Jeſus Chriſt, then it may diſcover to us the infinite hatred that God bears to ſin, that, to make expiation and attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his juſtice, there could no ſacrifice be found but the death of his eternal Son Jeſus Chriſt; Oh! that ever a ſinner ſhould delight in that, which the holy God ſo much hates and abhors?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let it be for convincement to poor ſinners <hi>of the infinite neceſſity</hi> of this way of <hi>Redemption</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt, in laying down his life to ſatisfie the juſtice of <hi>God,</hi> and of getting their part in it; you have heard the caſe of a Sinner, condemn'd by the Law, liable to eternal death, ſubject to the rigour of divine Juſtice, no way able or in a capacity to make ſatisfaction to God, mercy as it were bound up by juſtice; Oh! therefore what neceſſity of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, of a Redeemer, to work forth deliverance; to lay down a Ranſom for ſinners, dye and undergo the curſe and wrath of the great and dreadful God, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law, make ſatisfaction to the wronged ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of <hi>God</hi> to the utmoſt; this Jeſus Chriſt hath done for miſerable ſinners that will come unto him. Now the moſt of poor ſouls, have but a Notion of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:172030:68"/>
Chriſt's dying, but know not what is meant by <hi>Chriſt dying for me,</hi> though ſometimes in their Mouths; Oh! ſinner for Chriſt to die for thee, (if thou getteſt a part in his Death) is to undergo the puniſhment, and curſe, and death, that thy ſoul was liable to, which otherwiſe muſt have come upon thee to the utmoſt; it was to be made ſin and a curſe, for thee, to bear thy Sins, and ſtand in them; Oh! that thou couldſt really be convinc'd of <hi>the neceſſity of this Redemption,</hi> that thou couldſt never come to <hi>God</hi> without it, and therefore to get thy poor ſoul ſtated in it!</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> juſtice can only be by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, then let me again preſs you, that you take heed of performing your duties and repentings as if thereby you did <hi>ſatisfie</hi> and <hi>paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi> God for the ſin of your ſouls. This is the moſt dangerous ſnare upon poor ſouls, that though they have ſinned, yet they hope God will be pacified with ſome praying, and ſorrowing, and amendment: Now, though this ſhall be in a ſpiritual manner, upon every pardoned ſinner, and 'tis a capacity <hi>God</hi> puts the ſinner into, when he applies the death of his Son, and ſo gives out mercy and pardon, yet you muſt moſt carefully take heed, that you offer not up ſuch duties, as if they did make <hi>God</hi> amends, and pacifie him for your ſins; but look above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, as if they were not, and ſo to caſt your eye to the great ſacrifice of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which <hi>Alone</hi> makes attonement to <hi>God,</hi> and makes way for a poor ſinner to come to him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That as ſinners would learn the bleſſed Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Redemption, and the neceſſity of it, and how it makes attonement, merits mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, procures peace and reconciliation with <hi>God,</hi>
                           <pb n="133" facs="tcp:172030:68"/>
ſo they would come and <hi>accept</hi> of it, and fall down before the righteous <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>plead</hi> it to him; Thou haſt heard the way of <hi>God</hi>'s letting out mercy to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and no mercy but in that way, but by juſtice being ſatisfied by the death and blood of Jeſus Chriſt, whereby he becomes the Saviour of ſinners; now this blood is offered up to <hi>God,</hi> the price is paid and accepted with <hi>God,</hi> and in the Goſpel of <hi>God</hi> 'tis revealed and preach't to the guilty world, and 'tis <hi>freely offered</hi> to any poor ſinner, that will come and accept of it, and make claim to it, and plead for mercy and forgiveneſs upon the account of it, and will come to the <hi>terms</hi> of it, which is to be accepted and pardoned alone by vertue of it, to be waſhed and ſanctified, and actually deliver'd, not only from the guilt and condemnation of ſin, but the power, and reign, and pollution of it.</p>
                        <p>Oh Sinner! be awakened and ſtirred up by the word of the Lord, to get actual deliverance from the <hi>guilt, bondage, reign, ſervice,</hi> of thy ſin; go and cry to <hi>God,</hi> offer him up the blood of his own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son, tell him thou ſeeſt he may let out juſtice upon thee to deſtroy thee, and damn thee for ever; of thy ſelf thou haſt no plea againſt it: But ask the bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> if it may not be more glory to him, and his grace and mercy glorified by it, if he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſatisfaction by his own Son Jeſus Chriſt? plead to him, that thou heareſt he died in the room of guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, condemned ſinnners, <hi>ſuch as thou art, ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5.6. yea, tell him, with an humble adoration of his mercy and love in it, that thou heareſt in his bleſſed Goſpel, that 'tis offered to any ſinner that will come and accept it, and that 'tis proclamed from Heaven, and there's ſatisfaction made by the blood of a Jeſus for the greateſt Sinner, ſuch as thou art; Oh! cry

unto him, that therefore thou comeſt and begg'ſt to be heard in thy plea, and that it may be entred in Heaven, that thou comeſt for all the ends of his death, thou art weary of the ſervice of thy luſts, and the pollution of thy nature, and therefore thou wouldſt have thy nature cleanſed, thy conſcience purged, all which thou findeſt the blood of Jeſus Chriſt is able to do; yea, tell him, and plead it with ſome humble boldneſs, that thou art acquainted that Jeſus Chriſt prays in Heaven, for ſuch ſinners that come and plead his blood to thee, and that he is heard in what he prays, and that therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs muſt be had; yea, ſay, thou wilt hold on thy plea, thou haſt no other, and art reſolved againſt any other: If thou ſhalt to Hell pleading the blood of a Saviour, be it ſo, but I am reſolved to plead it to the utmoſt; yea, tell him, and cry to him, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>repent</hi> him, that he hath ordained the ſacrifice of the blood of his own Son, and therefore why ſhould'ſt thou be rejected? Yea, Come to this Iſſue, through the Spirit of Faith upon thee, that if it can be, that a Sinner crying out for pardon, upon the account of the death and blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and for ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, may go to Hell, then thou wilt willingly lay thy hand upon thy mouth, and open it no more, but ſink under Divine Vengeance to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                        <p>Oh! That every poor ſinner might go home with this plea in his heart, written there by the Holy Ghoſt; and peirce Heaven with his or her crys and groans, and put the blood of Jeſus Chriſt before him, and plead for mercy and holineſs, to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and ſanctified, till God ſay, Go in peace, thou art pardoned, redeemed, and bleſſed for ever.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. <hi>God</hi> is reſolved never to forgive you the Debt, till you have put in this Plea, and it be recorded in Heaven, and you have it in a Goſpel-way: No forgiveneſs of Sins, but by <hi>Redemption pleaded, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, poſſeſſed,</hi> and <hi>ſealed by the Holy Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 1.7, 14.</p>
                        <p n="4">4.

So for a Sinner to be in the Fetters of his Luſts, held faſt by them, a Bond-man to the Devil, and hear of a Chriſt laying down a Ranſom, what is this to him? unleſs he ſue it out, and get actual deliverance and liberty, the liberty of the Sons and Daughters of God, and have a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption,</hi> to cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>That being made free from ſin,</hi> (the Reign and Power of it, by the Power of the Lord Jeſus revealed in him) <hi>you may become ſervants to God, and have your fruit unto Holineſs, and the end everlaſting Life,</hi> Rom. 6.</p>

The Apoſtle in the 7th. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> having been opening the excellency of Chriſt's Prieſthood, which is chiefly converſant in this Work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the offering up of himſelf a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. of that Chapter. <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the utmoſt that come to God by him.</hi> To the utmoſt, that is, with a perfect Salvation, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more can be deſired to it. So in the 9th. Chap. <hi>ver.</hi> 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Apoſtle reaſoning from the Levitical Sacrifices, to this of the blood of Chriſt, argueth the full perfection of it. — <hi>By his own blood he entred in once into the holy place,</hi> (namely, into Heaven) <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained eternal Redemption for us;</hi> and thence concludeth, ver. 14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt purge the Conſcience?</hi> &amp;c. A <hi>much more</hi> upon that, above all the Sacrifices that were offered up to God; which will appear,</p>
                        <p n="1">1.

                        <p n="2">2. The price of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, did not only give a bare Satisfaction to the juſtice of God, but it had an infinite <hi>Merit</hi> in it, a <hi>redundancy of Merit,</hi> whereby it deſerved at the hands of God, that Sinners that are intereſſed in it, ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, grace, the love of God, and glory to come, ſpiritual bleſſings, which the death of Chriſt

                        <p n="3">3. The All-ſufficiency of the price of Chriſt's blood is evidenced by his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and Aſcenſion into Glory, implying that he wrought forth full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Redemption by his Death, therefore he is ſaid <hi>to riſe again for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>laſt.</hi> and to be <hi>juſtified in the ſpirit,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> that is, <hi>God</hi> by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him from the dead, juſtified him in the attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had made by his Death, and that he did chearfully accept of ſatisfaction by it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Blood of Chriſt procures <hi>boldneſs of acceſs to God,</hi> therefore there is an infinite worth in the price of it; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. <hi>Having therefore, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt, by the blood of Jeſus;</hi> which <hi>boldneſs</hi> doth ariſe from the full ſatisfaction that is made to Divine Juſtice, in as much as God, upon the Acceptance of it, hath nothing to charge upon the Sinner himſelf, no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt him, having charged his ſins upon Chriſt, and therefore the poor ſinner may come with an humble boldneſs into the Preſence of God; and this is that which puts boldneſs into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a Believer, when he appears before God.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. From the Experience of it; the ſouleſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that have come unto it, have been waſhed from their ſins by it, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11.

A poor ſinner when under conviction, and the terror of the Lord hath taken hold of him, lies trembling before the Lord, whether God will let out <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Mercy</hi> upon him; he is ready to give glory to the juſtice of the Lord, if he reject him for ever. But now if a poor ſoul get a ſight of the blood of Chriſt, how it deals with the juſtice of God, what full and all-ſufficient Satisfaction it hath made to God, for the ſins of ſuch as plead it to him, how God more delights in it, than in the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſinner, what a ſtay is this to the waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doubtful ſpirit of a poor ſinner? when he can come to ſee juſtice to have its due, and ſo God can freely let out Remiſſion to a poor Soul, upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt Act of a poor ſinners cloſing with it, though not preſently evidenced in his Conſcience; Oh, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>venture</hi> the Iſſue of all upon this price of the Blood of Jeſus, thou may'ſt ſee thou haſt the greateſt reaſon in the world to do ſo, thou wilt never come to have a ſafe bottom for thy Soul, till thou comeſt thus to deal with the juſtice of God, as fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, thou wilt ſtill be off and on about Free-Mercy, till thou come to fix here, and be in ſome good meaſure eſtabliſhed in it: Be daily in exerciſing thy Soul in ſuch ventures and caſtings upon it, and the Spirit will at laſt witneſs Peace and Reconciliation to thy Conſcience.</p>

When according to the purpoſe of God, through the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, a Sinner is <hi>called</hi> by grace, hath <hi>Faith</hi> given him, (as purchaſed alſo for him) to embrace Jeſus Chriſt in the Promiſe, to receive him as offer'd in the Goſpel, and with him all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings; then is the Soul put into the <hi>actual poſſeſſion</hi> of what God, in his purpoſe and love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to give him, and Jeſus Chriſt by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of his blood gave him a right to before, and ſo there is an <hi>Act</hi> of God's pardoning Mercy paſſeth upon the ſinnner, he hath an actual diſcharge given in unto his Conſcience, hath the Obedience of Jeſus Chriſt imputed to him, and ſo is look'd upon by God not as a Sinner under guilt, but as righteous
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:172030:73"/>
in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which beſpeaks him <hi>juſtified,</hi> that is, made juſt and righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, by the imputation and making over Chriſts Righteouſneſs to him, as if righteous in his own perſon: Upon which Act of God there is a full Remiſſion of ſin, as in the Text, and the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is put into another State, a State of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto life through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.1. who before was in a State of Death and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>Before I ſpeak of that Faith which, through Grace, puts a Soul in his pardoned and juſtified State, I will briefly apply this to the capacity of the weak.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It may inform and inſtruct you in this great <hi>Myſtery,</hi> that any ſinner that is ſaved muſt be thus <hi>juſtified,</hi> made righteous by the Obedience of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt;</hi> he muſt come to ſee the juſtice of God made up, a price paid unto God, and this to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made over to him: As we ſhall preſently ſhew; moſt of ſinners, 'tis to be feared, do not conſider this, that ſpeak of mercy, and pretend they hope in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but are never convinc'd of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and what it is to paſs from a ſtate of guilt to a ſtate of righteouſneſs by Jeſus Chriſt, from a ſtate of condemnation, to a ſtate of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without which, there can be no Salvation.</p>
                        <p>Oh be convinced, ſinners, of this great matter of the neceſſity of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in fulfilling the Law to be made over to you, to be brought into a juſtified ſtate, or you can never have pardon of ſin, and be accepted with God; you can never ſtand before God, but in the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. Say, If I do not get the righteouſneſs of Chriſt made mine: If I do not get thus juſtified,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:172030:74"/>
I muſt never expect pardon of my ſin, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of my poor ſoul at the great day of the Lord. This is the Work of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to be ſavingly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of this, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. Oh look up to the Father for the Spirit thus to convince you, not only of ſin, and the damnableneſs and ſinfulneſs thereof, but of your infinite need to get, not only ſome general hope of Mercy and Pardon, but the righteouſneſs of the Son of God, to bring you into a ſtate of Pardon, Reconciliation, Peace with God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It may further clear unto you, that your juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God is not <hi>within</hi> you, but <hi>without</hi> you, wrought forth by Jeſus Chriſt, for ſuch as are, or ſhall be called by grace, and <hi>imputed</hi> to them, not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent,</hi> or wrought in them: 'Tis not grace in you, that doth or can juſtifie you, though renewing grace ſhall be wrought in all that are ſo pardoned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified. Therefore, though thou muſt be changed in thy ſelf, pray and be holy, and obey God in all things, yet thou canſt not be hereby juſtified, but ſtill thy ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying righteouſneſs is in Chriſt, and not in thy ſelf, as the only procuring meritorious cauſe of Pardon, and Peace with God, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 33.16. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 54. laſt.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The great queſtion therefore that ſhould come upon thy heart, is, Whether thou art in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation or juſtification? If not juſtified, thou art ſtill, as I have ſhewed, under the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Law: Nothing thou haſt yet done or ſhalt ever be able to do, will ſtand between Wrath, and Hell, and thy poor ſoul, till thou comeſt to be juſtified in the blood and righteouſneſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Oh ſinners! ponder of this great thing that is now laid before you? Can you ſay from a Teſtimony within you? Oh! I <hi>was</hi> thus and thus
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:172030:74"/>
once under the reign, power, guilt, condemnation of ſin; but now, now, (bleſſed be rich and free grace) I am <hi>waſhed, juſtified,</hi> in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: See that Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, 11. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Or at leaſt, that I may ſpeak to poor, weak, willing, trembling ſouls: Is this it that your ſouls are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs after? Oh that I were, that I were, in ſuch a bleſſed ſtate! Oh that I could but believingly ſay, the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt were mine, and that now I am, I am juſtified! Oh what peace, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and joy, would fill my heart! Why Soul! If this be indeed the breathing of thy Soul, Jeſus Chriſt is thine, and thou art juſtified and pardoned, and <hi>God</hi> will at laſt give in unto thee (if thou continue to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him) the ſenſe and comfort of it in thy poor Soul: Only by the way take a Diſcovery or two of the <hi>reality</hi> of thy Heart in this matter.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. If thou Soul, from a Spiritual Conviction, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a real making out after juſtification by Jeſus Chriſt, then thou wouldſt alſo be as <hi>really</hi> ſanctified, be made holy. 'Twas as much in the purpoſe of <hi>God</hi> to call thee out of a ſtate of ſin, and to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee, as to pardon and juſtifie thee, 1 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 5.6.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If thou art brought into a juſtified ſtate, thy ſoul making out after it, thou art made alive in the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Thou art in Jeſus Chriſt, and wouldſt walk no more after the fleſh and the luſts thereof, but after the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. <hi>If ye are led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ye are not under the Law;</hi> namely, to condemn you, but are free from the curſe of it: And <hi>verſe</hi> 23. <hi>Againſt ſuch there is no Law;</hi> that is, ſuch as would
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:172030:75"/>
walk after the Spirit, be led by the Spirit; and ſhew forth the fruit of the Spirit: And this is that which the Apoſtle intimateth, 1 Ep. <hi>John</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witneſs in himſelf,</hi> namely, of the Spirit: So that every juſtified perſon hath the Spirit of Chriſt (according to the meaſure of the grace of God) dwelling in him, is quickened in the Spirit, being once dead; prays in the Spirit, mortifies ſin through the Spirit, is taught by the Spirit, and ſo in all other ſaving and ſanctifying vertues of it: If it be not thus with thee, thou, as yet, haſt no part in this bleſſedneſs, but art under condemnation unto death. And therefore, ſinner, come before God in the ſence of thy condemned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and give up thy ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt to be waſhed, juſtified, ſanctified; and then bleſſed for ever.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Let called and ſanctified Believers labour to live in the ſenſe of a pardoned, juſtified ſtate, that God is not <hi>off</hi> and <hi>on</hi> with them, in the matter of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, though it may be ſometimes darkned and clouded, as to the evidence of it. Oh! do you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to preſerve the ſenſe, and ſweet and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed peace of it in your ſouls, and give glory to the riches of grace; for, now there is <hi>No, No,</hi> condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you; you are paſſed from Death to Life, and the Bleſſed God imputes no ſin unto you: Let this be the higheſt and ſtrongeſt Argument to Holineſs, and love to the glory that poſſibly may be; and if indeed you walk in the comfort of it, it will be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
                        <p>Only let me give caution here to young Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, whoſe hearts, at the firſt diſcovery of the free and glorious grace of the Goſpel, and of Jeſus Chriſt, are wonderfully taken and affected with it, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:172030:75"/>
a time, are apt to wanton with it, (unleſs the firſt humiliation be the deeper) and to wax ſleight in Duties, and ſo their Luſts recover ſtrength again, and return upon them; and either they fall, or are near unto it, to the freſh wounding of their Souls. This hath been the condition of many; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be well caution'd in it, and walk with fear in the midſt of your joyous apprehenſions of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace, and the endearing love of the Lord Jeſus to you.</p>
                        <p>Having briefly ſhewed what the nature of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is, what it is to be in a juſtified ſtate before God, I now come to open more particularly how a Soul comes to be partaker of this juſtification, through the Redemption of Jeſus Chriſt; namely <hi>Through Eaith in his blood,</hi> ver. 25. of this 3d. of <hi>Rom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obſerv.</hi> As God, through Free-grace, hath ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt to work forth Redemption for ſinners; ſo there muſt be a ſpecial believing on, and applying the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, by every one that is ſaved.</p>
                        <p>Therefore juſtification is attributed to Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Therefore being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. and 3.11. In all which places. Faith is put in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the works of the Law. And ſo the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt is called the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith, Rom.</hi> 9.30. and 10.6. in oppoſition to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Works: Not as if Faith were the matter of our juſtification, that it did, as an Act or Work in the Soul, juſtifie before God; but that God doth thus make over the blood and righteouſneſs of Jeſus
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:172030:76"/>
Chriſt to a Soul, by enabling the Soul to come unto to take hold of, to apply to it ſelf, to appropriate the merit of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt for its own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Salvation, which may afford us a plain Deſcription of <hi>juſtifying Faith,</hi> preciſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; Namely,</p>
                        <p>Faith is a Work of the Holy Ghoſt in the Soul, enabling it to appropriate, or apply to it ſelf the blood and righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of ſin, and its juſtification unto eternal Life.</p>
                        <p>So it is called <hi>the work of Faith with power,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.11. and 'tis expreſſed by <hi>receiving</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. and <hi>believing</hi> on his Name, <hi>coming</hi> unto him, <hi>reſting</hi> upon him: So that, plainly, Faith is a going out to, believing in, truſting on another; namely, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For what it can never be able to find or bring about in or by it ſelf, which may lead us to the more particular way of the Holy Ghoſt's working this power in the Soul, in the ſaved ones of God.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In the working of Faith in the Soul, it is firſt brought to ſee an impoſſibility of coming to God, as <hi>in its ſelf,</hi> or <hi>by its ſelf,</hi> concluded under an utter una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to pacifie God, or make up a righteouſneſs in it ſelf, to get acceſs to God. The ſoul is emptied from veſſel to veſſel, till all the things that it counted gain before, become loſs for Jeſus Chriſt; this is the firſt work of the Spirit, it empties a poor ſinful Creature of all its refuges, all its dependencies, all its ſufficiencies, and ſo becomes naked in its guilt before God, and therefore is brought to this, that its acceptance to God, (if ever it be accepted) muſt be out of its ſelf; what ever become of him, he muſt periſh as in himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="149" facs="tcp:172030:76"/>2. In the work of Faith, the Soul is brought to ſee that this was the end of the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, of God's <hi>ſetting him forth</hi> to be a <hi>propitiation,</hi> that he might work forth Redemption and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that this is a way of God's own ordaining, Jeſus Chriſt was ſet forth for this very end, even by God himſelf, and therefore the ſoul is brought to this concluſion, to venture the Iſſue of its life, and eternal ſalvation upon it; and ſo throws it ſelf, as in a ſinking condition, upon the grace, blood, righteouſneſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſink or ſwim, live or periſh, ſaved or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; there the ſoul caſts Anchor, there it pitcheth, to this it will ſtand or fall before the righteous God; if there be not enough in the blood of Jeſus, to give it acceptance with God, the Soul reſolves, to Hell it muſt. There ſaith a poor ſelf-emptied Soul, I caſt even away my ſelf (if it might be) upon it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The ſoul is brought on to <hi>believe the report,</hi> that God in his word makes concerning his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and of the <hi>price, value, merit,</hi> and <hi>all-ſufficiency</hi> of his blood to ſave a poor ſinner, even to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that comes to God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. to anſwer all the wants and diſtreſſes of a poor ſoul, namely, in pacifying the Juſtice of God, fulfilling the Law, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king attonement, removing guilt, procuring remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, reconciling to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9, 10. <hi>Much more being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him: For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his Life:</hi> In all which things, the ſoul is enabled to believe the <hi>report</hi> of the Goſpel, that the blood and death of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>can</hi> do all this for poor ſinners that ſhall pitch upon it.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="150" facs="tcp:172030:77"/>4. In this working of faith, the ſoul comes to ſee and faſten upon an abſolue, unlimited <hi>Free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> where <hi>any</hi> ſinner that <hi>will,</hi> may come to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and ſo have the vertue of his death and blood applied to it; and therefore that he as well as any other ſinner in the world may come to him, and make claim to his blood, and plead it before God; <hi>whoſoever will, let him come!</hi> Rev. 22. Now ſaith a poor ſelf-emptied ſinner, I do not find that I am any where excluded, but invited and called upon, to come to the Lord Jeſus, and claim an intereſt in his blood, and that I may plead it even at the throne of his Juſtice, and that I may warrantably, ſafely, upon good grounds, given out from the mouth of God himſelf, take hold of the Lord Jeſus in ſuch a Promiſe, and there is no ſin or unworthineſs can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude me, unleſs I will frowardly and wretchedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my ſelf: I do not find, ſaith the poor ſoul, that any ſin is too great for the Sacrifice of that blood of Jeſus, ſo the ſinner will come to it, yea, that 'tis the greateſt ſin, and the top of condemnation, not to come to it; that I more injure God, by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off from Jeſus Chriſt, than by all the filthineſs, blaſphemies, ungodlineſſes, my Soul ever wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. The Blood of Chriſt is a price ſufficient for the ſins of the whole World, therefore, ſaith a poor ſoul, for mine; He is the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world, and therefore he can take away mine; and I am freely called and invited to it, and 'tis my Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to come, what can I have more? And ſo ſenſe of Peace, and Reconciliation falls in upon the Soul.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Soul by its often renewing of ſuch Acts of Believing, comes at laſt to ſee the blood of Jeſus
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:172030:77"/>
Chriſt appropriated to him; now it can ſtay it ſelf upon the word of promiſe; and can ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in believing. If I roll my ſelf upon the blood of Jeſus, I have the Word of God for it, that I <hi>ſhall be</hi> ſaved, <hi>we ſhall be ſaved from Wrath</hi> through him; not, it <hi>may be,</hi> but, we <hi>ſhall be</hi> ſaved, and all upon the account of being juſtified by his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. which juſtification ariſeth upon this believing we have mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I opened the nature of Faith, as it is <hi>preciſely</hi> juſtifying, as it applies and appropriates the blood and righteouſneſs of the Lord Jeſus, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and Juſtification unto eternal Life; I might inſiſt upon the diſcovery of the effectual o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of Faith in the Soul, as may diſtinguiſh it from a meer belief of the Hiſtory of the death of Jeſus Chriſt; take two or three.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. When the Soul by Faith doth act upon the blood of Jeſus Chriſt for juſtification, it doth alſo bring the power and efficacy of it, for purging of the Soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit, offer'd himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your Conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God;</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying your hearts by faith.</hi> There is a purifying vertue in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt upon the ſouls of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; they are for the <hi>purging</hi> away the <hi>filth,</hi> as well as the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin; there's no believing ſoul but crys out, Purge me, Oh Lord, purge me, and throughly, from my filth.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſoul hath a ſecret, yet real fellowſhip with the death of Jeſus Chriſt, to crucifie and deſtroy the body of ſin in a juſtified believer which ariſeth from its union with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>For if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:172030:78"/>
alſo in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection; knowing that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true believer can really ſay, <hi>I am,</hi> or I would be, <hi>Crucified with Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there brings in as an effect of Juſtification by Faith.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Every juſtified believer looks upon this as one great end of his Juſtification, <hi>that he might live to God,</hi> Gal. 2.19. <hi>That I might live unto God. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reckon ye your ſelves to be dead indeed unto him, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6.11. Every juſtified Believer doth thus reckon of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I am to be dead to ſin, but alive to God, I am to yield my ſelf to God, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. To have my fruit unto <hi>Holineſs, verſe</hi> 22.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Faith that juſtifies, doth through the Spirit work the Soul to Goſpel-obedience, to all the Laws and Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, which ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to be the Will of Chriſt, from the Command of Jeſus Chriſt, and from a principle of love to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15.10.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. A juſtifi'd believer will <hi>deny himſelf for Chriſt,</hi> take up his croſs and follow him; let any ſufferings be propoſed to a called believer, and let him know it is for Jeſus Chriſt, and that ſoul (unleſs under a temporary deſertion or temptation) will chooſe and embrace thoſe ſufferings, and undergo them with ſome chearfulneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, 27.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Every juſtified believer hath a <hi>Marriage <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 5.25, 26, 32. The ſoul hath choſen Jeſus Chriſt, having broken off from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lovers, hath betrothed it ſelf unto Chriſt, in an everlaſting Bond and Covenant, hath given it ſelf to Chriſt; as Jeſus Chriſt beſtows himſelf and all he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:172030:78"/>
hath upon the ſoul, ſo doth the ſoul beſtow it ſelf, and all it hath, upon Jeſus Chriſt, and having ſo done, reſolves to be contented with him in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>whom have I in Heaven but thee? and none on earth in compariſon of thee;</hi> ſaith every gracious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Every juſtified Believer <hi>lives by his Faith;</hi> Gal. 2.20. lives upon Jeſus Chriſt for all, and fetcheth all from him, ſees him as a Treaſury of all Grace, hath recourſe unto him, this being the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act of Faith, to make the ſoul live out of it ſelf, upon another, Namely, Jeſus Chriſt for all.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Faith that entitles the Soul to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>works by love to all Saints,</hi> Gal. 5.6. When the Soul cloſeth with Jeſus Chriſt, it will alſo cloſe with his Diſciples, as diſtinguiſhed from carnal, unſavoury, dead Profeſſors. What makes the living among the dead? a living Soul, alive in Chriſt, highly priſeth fellowſhip with ſuch as are alive.</p>
                        <p>I might name many more particulars, but theſe may ſuffice, as the moſt diſtinguiſhing.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:172030:79"/>
and my poor Soul! I would, I do, beſtow my ſelf upon him, and all that's mine; I do give my ſelf to him! I will be content with him here, and for ever: Whom have I, whom have I, but him? Oh, have you found, in ſome good degree, ſuch Workings of heart towards Jeſus Chriſt! And do you live by your Faith, upon Chriſt, upon Promiſes? and do you maintain your Souls this way: And do you love, and delight in the Fellowſhip of living Souls, ſavoury Souls; or do you, at leaſt, long that you may have ſome opportunity to do ſo? If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, in ſome meaſure, experience theſe things, your Faith is a dead empty Speculation; ſuch a Faith that is ſo far from uniting you to Chriſt, that indeed it keeps you on this ſide Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore ſay of it, 'tis a Faith that <hi>is in vain,</hi> that keeps me dead in my ſins: Oh therefore, ſay in thy heart, I will now wait on the Word, the Miniſtration of it, that is ordained of God to beget Faith; I will go and pray the Father to draw me to Jeſus Chriſt, and that my Soul may be united to him, that I may have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in his Death and Reſurrection; that I may be made alive unto God; that I may feel the pacifying, purging vertue of the blood of the Lord Jeſus upon my poor Soul.</p>
                        <p>By what hath been ſaid, Believers may try their Faith; and if they find their Souls to have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theſe things, they may take comfort that they are juſtified by Faith in the blood of Jeſus, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſhall</hi> be ſaved by his Life.</p>
                        <p>To wind up all in a word of Exhortation.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. God hath <hi>ſet forth</hi> Jeſus Chriſt to be a <hi>Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> that through <hi>Faith in his blood,</hi> a ſinner may become <hi>juſtified</hi> from his ſin, then what encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is there for ſinners to come to him, and believe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:172030:79"/>
on his Name, to venture the Iſſue of Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him, ſince God himſelf hath <hi>ſet him forth</hi> for that end and purpoſe, that ſinners might come unto him, and be waſhed, juſtified, ſaved from their ſins. 'Tis not then to be doubted but that God as he hath therein taken care for the Salvation of the ſinner, ſo for the glory of his own righteouſneſs: So that the ſinner hath no reaſon to doubt, that comes to Jeſus in the way propoſed but that God can take pleaſure to accept of him through the blood of Jeſus. 'Twas the moſt <hi>deliberate</hi> Act that ever the Wiſdom of God was taken up about the ſetting forth of Jeſus Chriſt, to be the Saviour of Sinners through his Blood: 'Twas the firſt Foundation that God laid from all Eternity; and after he had promiſed Jeſus Chriſt, it was ſome thouſands of years before he ſet him forth to the world: And therefore God cannot repent nor change his mind and purpoſe as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting, pardoning, juſtifying, ſanctifying poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that caſt their Souls upon it, by the Blood of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. Upon which it is, that bleſſed Souls are brought in, in the Scriptures, magnifying the grace of God for their cleanſing by the blood of Jeſus, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin:</hi> So are the Saints brought forth <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing,</hi> Revel. 5.9. <hi>Thou waſt ſlain, and hath redeemed us to God by thy blood:</hi> And Chap. 7.14. <hi>Theſe are they who have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.</hi> Therefore, I ſay, with what boldneſs may poor ſinners come unto it? and how certainly are they in God's way to Salvation? in which way bleſſed Souls have been ever found, and none did ever miſs of this end, the Salvation of their Souls.</p>
                        <p>I have now diſpatcht what I ſhall ſpeak at this

                        <p>THE former Verſes intermitted, might have afforded us much choice matter, in the opening the Doctrine of Grace, and the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; Namely, that God is juſt in the remiſſion of a Believer, upon Faith in the Blood of Jeſus, from <hi>verſe</hi> 26. And that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Grace excludes all boaſting from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from <hi>ver.</hi> 27. That Jew and Gentile, all that are ſaved, muſt come to God, and be juſtified in this way, and no other, from <hi>ver.</hi> 29, 30. But I muſt contract my ſelf. I come now to the Objection, that the Heart, ſo far as it is carnal, doth naturally make againſt this Doctrine: Namely, If a Soul be only ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Grace, through the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, doth not this then make void the Law, and all Obedience to it? What need then of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, we eſtabliſh it,</hi> that is, the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, doth rather eſtabliſh it. The Law doth ſtand eſtabliſht in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt hath eſtabliſht it by <hi>fulfilling</hi> it,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:172030:80"/>
whereby the righteouſneſs of the Law is fufilled upon us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. Jeſus Chriſt perfectly fulfilled the Law, and kept it, and ſo makes over the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it to Believers, as hath been ſhewed; and ſo the Law ſtands eſtabliſht.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Law ſtands eſtabliſht as a means, through the Spirit, to <hi>convince</hi> of ſin, and of our ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the righteouſneſs of it; as <hi>ver.</hi> 20. And ſo Chriſt often made uſe of it for ſuch ends.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Law ſtands eſtabliſht as an Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule of righteouſneſs and holineſs, promiſed in the New Covenant to be written in the Heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.</p>
                        <p>So that, through Jeſus Chriſt, in juſtifying by his blood, hath quit the ſinner from all guilt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation by the Law; yet he hath not given the Believer a diſcharge from all obedience of it: And therefore to evince this, I ſhall lay down this Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Though all a Believer hath done, or can do, cannot juſtifie him before God; yet there are other bleſſed ends, why he ſhould obey God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his Law.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Obedience to God is placed as the great End of our redemption, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. — <hi>That we might ſerve him without fear,</hi> (a ſear of bondage) <hi>in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the days of our life.</hi> God hath not only in his purpoſe the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation of the Sinner, but that thereby he would have all that are called into this grace to <hi>ſerve him in Holineſs.</hi> And this end is to be upon the heart of the Believer, when juſtified by Faith: The purpoſe of God in this, is, that I ſhould ſerve
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:172030:81"/>
him in holineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. That I ſhould live to God <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. as hath been ſhewed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Sovereign Command of God,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Be ye holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15, 16. This is enough to a Believer, that God hath commanded it, though there ſhould be no other end in it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Holineſs and Righteouſneſs is the Soul's <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto God;</hi> it is a Beam of God, an Image of God, which he deſigns to be renewed upon all that ſhall be ſaved; as ſhall be further ſhewed.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Juſtified Believers do ſee an equity, goodneſs, and bleſſedneſs in the Law of God, in all his holy and righteous Precepts, though they were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The Law is holy, juſt and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking after the regenerate part. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 119. often, <hi>Thy Commandmeats which I have loved.</hi> They give God his due, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his due; and therefore to be walkt in, though not thereby juſtified.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. There is a principle of <hi>love to God, ſhed abroad in the heart</hi> of every juſtified Believer, from the ſenſe of his rich, pardoning grace, the freeneſs of his love which acts and conſtrains a Soul to take delight ſo far as it is regenerated, in every Command of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>For the Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live ſhould not live to themſelves, but to him that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Called and juſtified Believers have <hi>bleſſed ſights</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, that wonderfully take their hearts: They have glimpſes of the Beauty of his Holineſs and would therefore be made like unto him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2, 3. They would obey the Will of the Father, as Jeſus Chriſt did: They would be holy and righteous, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:172030:81"/>
wiſe, and patient, and Heavenly, as Jeſus Chriſt was.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Believers, in the way of their Duty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, have bleſſed Fellowſhip and Communion with God: Saith God of his Ordinances, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.22. <hi>There will I meet thee, and commune with thee:</hi> And <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. — <hi>In all places where I record my Name, there will I come unto thee, and bleſs thee.</hi> They are everlaſting Promiſes to all the ways of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, wherein the people of God do walk before him in. They pray, they read, hear, they partake of the Supper in Chriſts way, and there they have life and bleſſing to their Souls, and many a ſweet inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of love and mercy they have whiſpered into them; they ſet themſelves to walk with God in his fear and counſel, and God walks with them; and their lives, if they keep cloſe to God, are ſweet and comfortable to them. And this is even as much to them, as if they were thereby juſtified: They would not miſs the ſweetneſs they meet with in ſuch ways of Duty for all the World.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. By their Sanctification and Obedience, their juſtification is comfortably evidenced to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of ſin unto Death, or of obedience unto Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> And — <hi>Ye know that every one that doth righteouſneſs is born of him,</hi> 1 John 2.29. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> So that, no doubt, Believers may come to a ſweet and bleſſed Evidence of their good eſtate, and of their juſtification by the work of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in them, and their willing obedience to <hi>God,</hi> though a Believer doth not always, and at all times, fetch in his evidence of Believing, and of comfort,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:172030:82"/>
this way; but ſometimes from the Promiſe, and from the more immediate Teſtimony of the Spirit. But though a Believer doth not, and it may be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not always fetch in his conſolation and peace from Sanctification and Obedience: Yet that ſoul that wholly neglects it, and ſlights Evidences from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, Sanctification, and Obedience, had beſt timely look to it, that the Witneſs in himſelf he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to, be not from imagination of his own heart, from the wicked ones deluſion, and from ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notions of grace that may affect his heart, but leave him on this ſide Regeneration.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Believers do perform their Duties, as <hi>returns</hi> to God: Every called Believer ſaith in his heart, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 116.12. Oh! <hi>What ſhall I render to thee?</hi> How gracious hath God been? and now how holy ſhould I be? Who ſhall love the Lord, and fear before him, and praiſe him, If I ſhall not? To whom ſhall his Name, Laws, Ordinances, be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if not unto me? Who is more bound to love the bleſſed God than I? and how ſhall I love him but by obeying him? Thus doth a Believer perform his obedience, as a Teſtimony of a thankful return to God; though I do not ſay, that this is all his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. By the Obedience and Holineſs of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, God is much glorified in the World; 'tis the greateſt glory that God deſigns to himſelf in the World, even by the holineſs, and willing, gracious obedience of his people to him. When the World lies in wickedneſs, and makes war againſt the great and Holy God, this is that which honours God, that he hath a people, called by his grace, that ſet forth the glory of holineſs in the world, that are witneſſes to the holineſs of God, the holineſs of his Worſhip,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:172030:82"/>
and all his ways, and profeſs and endeavour to walk in them! and by this, others are brought on to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God on their behalf, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</p>

                        <p>I Have been opening the difference between the Righteouſneſs of the Law and the Goſpel, ſhewing the Neceſſity, Nature, and Way of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Goſpel-juſtification by the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and have diſcovered a Soul eſtated therein; I ſhall now endeavour to open the <hi>Goſpel New Creature,</hi> peculiarly, as diſtinguiſht from that which is called (in appearance) a Legal-New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now let a ſoul fail in either of theſe, and loſt for ever, fail of a ſaving cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt for righteouſneſs, or being a New Creature in Chriſt, and you periſh in your ſins, and the wrath of God will overtake you.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not now take up time in opening the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the words, nor will it much be deſired, as to our deſign: I ſhall therefore draw this plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from them. Namely,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="165" facs="tcp:172030:84"/>Obſerv. <hi>There's an abſolute neceſſity, in order to the Salvation of every ſoul, to become a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Having proved it, we ſhall open the way of being a New Creature, and how in Chriſt: Then how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from an appearing New Creature, (but not ſo indeed) and ſo give forth the Evidences of it. Thoſe Scriptures that ſpeak of the neceſſity of being <hi>born again of the Spirit,</hi> John 3.3, 5. And of being <hi>converted,</hi> Mat. 8.3. do evince the ſame truth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Neither Circumciſion, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, avail any thing, but a New Creature. For we are his Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip created unto Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> Epheſ. 2.10. <hi>He that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing is God, and hath given us the earneſt of his Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.5.</p>
                        <p>The neceſſity of this New-Creature doth ariſe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the <hi>tenour of the New Covenant,</hi> in which way God hath obliged himſelf to give out mercy; and in no other. Now thus runs the <hi>New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> this is the great Article of it; <hi>Make you a new heart, and a new Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 11.31. Which God promiſeth to give to all he takes into a Covenant of mercy and peace with himſelf; <hi>I will put a new Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within you, and a new heart will I give unto you,</hi> Ezek. 11.19. And to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. Wherein, as we ſhall ſhew, lies the ſpecial part of the New-Creature.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Old man, all that is of the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the whole frame thereof is corrupted and polluted; therefore it muſt be repaired, renewed, be made new, if ever it enter into glory, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. <hi>That ye put off concerning the Former Converſation, the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:172030:85"/>
Old man, which is corrupt, according to the deceitful Luſts, and be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind; and that ye put on the New man, that after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Whoſoever ſhall be ſaved, ſhall be a New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from the great deſign of God in giving out his Son Jeſus Chriſt, which was, that all the Elect ſhould be made conformable to the <hi>Image of his Son, Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>For whom he did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son that he might be the firſt born among many Brethren.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is called the <hi>expreſs Image of the Father, Heb.</hi> 1. And to that <hi>Image</hi> all Believers ſhall be conformed: Jeſus Chriſt, the firſt-born, and all his Brethren, to be made conformable unto him. God was infinitely pleaſed with ſuch a <hi>Pattern,</hi> and reſolved all that he gave to him, and deſigned for glory, ſhould be conformed to his likeneſs.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. All the ſervices that a ſinner offers to God, are not accepted, till a <hi>New Creature;</hi> till a Soul ſhall act from a new, living, holy principle, towards God, Pray, and hear, and give Alms, God regards it not, till a New-Creature: So the Word of the Lord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten caſts back the ſervices of unregenerate men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their faces, as loathſom to the Lord, becauſe they proceed from the old corrupt <hi>Adam,</hi> from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed Natures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. <hi>When you cry, I will not hear you;</hi> Why? You are in your uncleanneſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Waſh you, make you clean.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Oh let this make for your Inſtruction and Conviction, that if ever you come to God in glory, you muſt firſt be New-Creatures: If you will have mercy, you muſt have it in the way of the New-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and if ſo, you muſt be made new: While you
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:172030:85"/>
have nothing but the <hi>Old Adam,</hi> you are corrupt, and polluted, and abominable. If you ſhall become the Brethren of the firſt-born, Jeſus Chriſt, you muſt bear his Image, and have it renewed upon you. Oh, you that are yet in your <hi>old ſins,</hi> and walk after your <hi>Old Luſts,</hi> you are not New Creatures: You will not think ſo, thefore ſit down with this conviction, That as yet you have no part in this bleſſedneſs. Oh! All of you who are the <hi>ſame</hi> that ever you were, whether living in groſs ſins, or ſober and civil from your youth up, you are yet of the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but corrupt nature upon you: Your hope is vain, and you are blinded in your ſins, and the Grace of God is not in you.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Oh! Let me before I go further, put this to tryal, and ſuffer the word of the Lord which ſhall one day judge you; can you ſay in good earneſt, <hi>Old things are paſt away, and all things are become new in me?</hi> Now I am a Veſſel in the hand of God, wrought by his Spirit, and there is through infinite grace a new <hi>workmanſhip</hi> upon my Soul? I ſhall lay down rules for the particular diſcovery of this, only at preſent yield up your conſcience to the power of the Word, do not ſlink from under it; if it find you out in your ſin, in nature, the ſame that ever you were, give glory to God, and ſay, the word of the Lord is quick and powerful, and go off with this conviction in power upon thy ſoul, I never expect to go to Heaven and glory, if I become not (through Grace) a New Creature.</p>
                        <p>But before I go further, I would open, that every ſoul that is a New Creature, muſt <hi>be in Chriſt;</hi> and why.</p>
                        <p>So ſaith the Apoſtle to theſe <hi>Corinths,</hi> in this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:172030:86"/>
Epiſtle, 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, prove your own ſelves, know you not that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi> ye are <hi>created into Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Epheſ. 2.10.</p>
                        <p>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt out as a Branch, and is withered, <hi>John</hi> 15.6.</p>
                        <p>Now herein lies the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, unto which all our Evidences for Heaven are reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore this is a weighty enquiry. I am to ſpeak of it, eſpecially as it relates to the making and forming the New-Creature.</p>
                        <p>This being <hi>in Chriſt</hi> is expreſſed by being <hi>rooted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.7. <hi>Planted into him,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>Built up in him.</hi> Col. 2. All which beſpeaks a real <hi>union</hi> with him; that this is not a meer imaginary thing, but as true and real as the union between the root and the branches, <hi>John</hi> 15. and the foundation, and the building, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. which is wrought by the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, drawing and uniting true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto him; the ſame Spirit dwelling in them; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10, 11. — <hi>By his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now to conſider, Why all that are New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to the Goſpel, muſt be ſo <hi>in Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. Such as are Goſpel <hi>New Creatures</hi> muſt be <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> becauſe if they be <hi>New Creatures,</hi> they muſt be <hi>Living</hi> Creatures. Now God hath laid up all <hi>life,</hi> that ſhall be diſpenced forth, in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5.21, 26. — <hi>The Son quickneth whom he will;</hi> for as the Father hath life in himſelf, <hi>So he hath given to the Son to have Life in himſelf; Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> John 14.19. Now naturally all ſinners are <hi>dead</hi> in the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and utterly unable to beget life in themſelves: Who can make
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:172030:86"/>
alive his own ſoul? but when they were New-born, as new Creatures, they are ſaid to be quickned in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5. As God breathed life into man at firſt, and ſo he became a living ſoul; ſo in the <hi>new Creation,</hi> the ſoul is ſaid to be <hi>created into Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2.10. and to be made <hi>Alive in him,</hi> Rom. 6.11.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If there were not a real union of the ſoul with Chriſt, life (if it ſhould be given without it) would not be preſerved in the ſoul, <hi>Thou holdeſt our Soul in life,</hi> Pſal. 66.9. As the branch, though it was once quickned, cannot preſerve its life, if cut off from the root; and therefore a continued ſupply of life from Jeſus Chriſt, to the ſoul, is neceſſary, as to all its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual actings as a new Creature.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. By being in Chriſt, the Soul is made <hi>partaker of the divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. by which the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part, all gracious habits are infuſed in the ſoul, whereby the New Creature is formed up in believers. Hence it is, that all grace and holineſs is infuſed into the Soul, as diſtinguiſh'd from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace, that at laſt withereth, <hi>John</hi> 15.6. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he he is caſt forth as a branch, and is withered,</hi> &amp;c. therefore a neceſſity of being in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Without being in Chriſt, the power and reign of ſin, the body of ſin, will not be deſtroyed; no deſtroying the body of ſin, by any poſſible endeavours, but by the influence of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and a real fellowſhip therewith, which cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but by being planted into Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>For if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:172030:87"/>
we might not ſerve ſin:</hi> All the proper morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying power that Believers have of the body of ſin, is drawn from fellowſhip with the death of Jeſus Chriſt, which fellowſhip ariſeth only from being one with him.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Image of God cannot be renewed upon us, but in Chriſt: <hi>As we have born the images of the Earthly, we ſhall alſo bear the Image of the heavenly;</hi> 1 Cor. 15.19. So Rom. 8.29. — we are <hi>made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Image of his Son;</hi> by union a Soul is made partaker of the fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, as all grace is laid up in him, and of that fulneſs partakes by meaſure of every grace from him, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>And of his fulneſs have all we recieved, and grace for grace;</hi> that is, Grace according to the pattern of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, partaking of every grace in him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure allowed to every Member and Branch in him.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Without being in Chriſt, no duty is accepted with God; by being in Chriſt, we are accepted in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whereby all the duties of a child of God are accepted with the Father, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. as performed by a Principle of life from Jeſus Chriſt, and offered up to God in the name and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt; otherwiſe let praying and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties be never ſo ſtrictly, frequently, devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed, they find no accptance with God, and the Soul is not bettered by them: <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> John 15. ſaith Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Without being in Jeſus Chriſt there can be no holy fruit in converſation brought forth to God, John 15.5. <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit:</hi> All the fruit that is of our own ſtock, comes to nought; but the fruit that is brought forth in Chriſt, from implantation into
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:172030:87"/>
him, is precious fruit unto Repentance. Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, and doing of any good, unleſs it proceed from the life we have in Chriſt, is Phariſaical, and comes to nothing, and will be burnt up in the day of the Lord; wherefore ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified believers are call'd the trees of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. as planted, engrafted into Jeſus Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they bring forth all their ſavoury fruit unto God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> See now the great, and weighty, and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable neceſſity of getting into Chriſt, of having union with him, the main pillar, upon which hangs all your comfort; do what ye will, and be out of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and 'tis an accurſed, loathed ſacrifice; do what thou wilt from thy own ſtock, and 'tis bitter fruit: A dram of what is performed in Chriſt, is of more worth than a mighty, daily bulk of duties without it; not hereby to leſſen a believer, as to muchneſs of duty, but to ſhew the unacceptableneſs of all duties, though never ſo <hi>many, long, devout,</hi> till a poor ſoul performs all from a new principle, and power of life in the ſoul from Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo a New-Creature.</p>
                        <p>Oh! that poor ſouls were throughly convinc'd of this, who, ſo they perform duties, never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this. Oh! lay to heart thy <hi>dead</hi> condition, and the infinite neceſſity of getting into Chriſt: No life in thy ſoul, no preſerving of life, till in Jeſus Chriſt; nothing of the divine nature upon thee, no deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin, nothing of the Image of God upon thee that is ſaving, no duty accepted, no fruit unto God in thy converſation, till thou haſt the real experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this bleſſed Myſtery in thy ſoul, of being one in Chriſt, through the ſpirit, till thy ſoul know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what union and fellowſhip with the Son of God meaneth: Therefore ſouls that fall ſhort here,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:172030:88"/>
their knowledge, profeſſion, converſation, is loſt labor, as to the great matter of eternal life and ſalvation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If all that are truly and ſavingly <hi>New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are in Chriſt,</hi> then a New Creature any other way, is but a ſemblance and appearance of it, and not ſo indeed and reallity; if from our ſelves, from the power of the Law upon the Conſcience, or upon any other account whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>And therefore, I ſtill ſay, the more we conſider of this matter, of the more narrow enquiry do we find it to be.</p>
                        <p>There is a ſemblance and likeneſs of being New-Creatures, which is not really ſo, a ſemblance of Holineſs, a holy fruit, which is not truly ſo, but will at laſt <hi>wither;</hi> and hence, all the withered Profeſſors in this day, as we ſhall preſently ſhew.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not here ſpeak of ſuch, as pretend to no manner of change inward or outward, ſuch as are in all things, the ſame they ever were, as ſuch as live in known groſs ſins, they have no appearance or pretence of claim to the Title and Character of the New Creature; by their own conceſſion and acknowledgment they are ſtill the ſame as ever they were, therefore, not ſo much as pretend to be made new; to ſuch I ſhall, if God will, apply a further word before we have done.</p>
                        <p>Only now of the <hi>Semblance of the New Creature</hi> (falſly ſo called) but not really ſo.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A ſoul being convinc'd of the damnableneſs of ſuch and ſuch a ſin, from the Law, and the power of the Word upon the Conſcience, that a ſoul living, continuing in it, ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of God: As from ſuch a place, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not enter into the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:172030:88"/>
Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither Fornicators, Adulterers, Idolaters, nor Effeminate, nor Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God. And ſuch were ſome of you,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, from this or the like Scripture, a ſoul may be convinced, that if he continued in any of theſe groſs wickedneſſes, he ſhall never ſee the face of God, and ſo may take up from the groſs outward Acts of them, or at leaſt, from a frequent commiting them; now this perſon may go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and becauſe he hath left ſome ſpecial groſs ſin, he thinks himſelf a true Convert, and a New-man, and may flatter himſelf with the conceit of being the New-Creature we are to ſet forth; but no New <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> man, no coming to Chriſt, not being in Chriſt; and it may be feared, many Souls are under this dreadful ſnare.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such a kind of outward Reformation may ariſe from ſpecial Judgment and Affliction upon a ſinner, trembling that God bath ſmitten him for ſuch a ſin, and ſo may take up from it; and this alſo often paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth for converſion; not but that ſometimes God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the firſt ſtroke by laying his hand upon a ſinner, but I ſpeak of a meer taking up from a prophane courſe, and never getting into Jeſus Chriſt, which many reſt themſelves in.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A ſinner may leave ſome ſins of youth, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with riper years; and upon that may take himſelf to be a Convert, or a kind of New-Creature, to be changed and turned from what he was; but no forſaking this ſin with loathing of it, as againſt God, no brokenneſs of heart for it, and the root of it ſtill unſubdued in his heart.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A ſinner may take up from ſome groſs ſins, as
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:172030:89"/>
inconſiſtent with reputation, <hi>credit</hi> in the World, or his <hi>profit</hi> and wordly advantage; ſo many debaucht perſons turn to be great worldlings, and yet take themſelves to be good Converts, when they have turned from a ſin that would waſte their Eſtates, to be wretched worldlings; yet theſe go away with a good opinion of themſelves.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Sinners may take up and reform, to get the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſome Religious Friend or great Perſon that doth countenance Religion, in hope of ſome ſpecial preferment or honour by them; and ſo get a form of Profeſſion, an Ability to ſpeak of good things, own the beſt people, hear good men, and yet all this proceed from a rotten heart, as it was with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 1. Hoping after great gain by the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, the gift of Miracles, and yet was <hi>in the Gall of Bitterneſs and bond of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. Souls may have a kind of Conviction, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up to ſome new duties, in the ſinful neglect of which they have long lived; as to a kind of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Prayer, in obſerving the Sabbath more ſtrictly, read more, hear more, (things good in themſelves, when uſed as means to find Jeſus Chriſt in) and yet may continue long in theſe, and not a Goſpel New-Creature in Chriſt; never humbled ſo as to be emptied of themſelves, and come to Jeſus Chriſt, as for Righteouſneſs, ſo for life and ſtrength for the performance of all duties, and ſubduing of all Sin, and therein chiefly the Legal New-Creature (ſo called) doth conſiſt, in taking up to moſt known outward duties, ſomething ſtrictly, and make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of them, as of groſs outward ſins, and yet no Goſpel New-Creature. I wiſh there are not too many ſuch.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <pb n="175" facs="tcp:172030:89"/>7. A Soul may take himſelf to be a New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, from ſome good liking that he hath of ſuch as are better than himſelf, and ſome <hi>purpoſes and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to be better, which purpoſes for a time carry a man forth, till new Temptations, and then they will not bear a man forth: Thus you ſhall find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinners purpoſing and ſtrongly reſolving to take up, to avoid ſuch courſes they have found to end in trouble, and yet fall back again, becauſe purpoſing in themſelves, and not getting into Chriſt for ſtrength, and theſe think themſelves to be a kind of New-Creatures.</p>

                        <p>Before I go any further, let me bring home, if the Lord will, theſe things to your Conſciences, and let it be a word to find out ſuch whoſe conditions have been opened.</p>

of your credit among men, or your worldly profits, ſins in which you could not thrive in your Eſtates: If this be all, know it, that you are not the New-Creatures we are ſpeaking of, you are far from the Kingdom of God; and if you come no farther, even to ſee your ſelves wholly at a loſs, and ſo get to Jeſus Chriſt, you are damned for ever.</p>
                        <p>Yea, if any for the Favour of Men, or ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantage, have taken up a ſeeming profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion above the ordinary rate, and this be your main principle; know, thou art ſeven times the Child of the Devil more than thou waſt, to deal thus Atheiſtically and Hypocritically with the great God, who will one day lay thee open to all the world, and thou ſhalt be confounded in thy ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of this thy abominable iniquity.</p>

                        <p>Now another degree of Miſtakes of the New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth ariſe from the taking of <hi>Common Grace,</hi>
                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:172030:90"/>
(which a Hypocrite may reach to) for truth of <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſanctifying <hi>Grace;</hi> and know, that every Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite doth not know himſelf to be ſuch, but a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is one that appears to himſelf and others, to be what he is not; he takes himſelf to be a good Chriſtian, a Believer, a New Creature, and is not ſo. The ground of ſome of theſe great Miſtakes I ſhall mention.</p>
                        <p>As firſt, A poor Creature thinks himſelf ſafe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what he doth, he thinks he doth it all with a <hi>good heart.</hi> No one ſo confident of the goodneſs of his heart as a Hypocrite, becauſe he knows not his own heart; in that great Reformation in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> time <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.10. that <hi>Judah turned</hi> to the Lord but <hi>feignedly, not with the whole Heart:</hi> Yet the people thought otherwiſe with themſelves, as 'tis likely, when they entred into a Covenant with God, with good <hi>Joſiah.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is that moſt poor ſinful Creatures do bolſter up themſelves with, in their Ignorance and Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they do all to God and Men with good hearts; whereas a renewed Soul doubts of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart, and hath matter of humbling for it in every duty.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another miſtake of poor ſouls is, (as to the Goſpel-New-Creature) from a <hi>miſpriſion of ſins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> for ſuch as are indeed <hi>reigning, damning ſins;</hi> As to inſtance, to lye for advantage, to ſwear petty Oaths ſometimes, by Faith and Troth, by the Maſs, to mention God's Name frequently, as a by-word, crying, Oh Lord, Oh God, ſlightly, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or ſometimes to drink to exceſs, or the like evils: 'Tis common to hear wretched Souls, when convinc'd of them, to excuſe the matter: Why, 'tis their <hi>infirmity,</hi> whereas it proceeds from a heart
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:172030:91"/>
wholly unregenerate, and under the power and reign of ſin.</p>
                        <p>Infirmities of the Children of God are not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them, but humbled, mourned for, every day watch'd againſt, the root of them they endeavour to mortifie through the Spirit; which the common profeſſor that calls all his ſins his infirmities, doth not; Oh! Souls, there's a vaſt difference between the infirmities of ſuch as are indeed <hi>New-Creatures,</hi> and between the reigning ſins of natural men; ſin reigns in its peace, power, habit, in the heart, no ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, crucifying, purging, which a New-Creature doth and hath.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This miſtake of the New-Creature doth ariſe from a miſconcieving of the reluctancy of a natural conſcience, before or in the committing of ſin; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it for the <hi>Conflict</hi> that is in a truly regenerate Soul, between the Regenerate and Carnal part; which miſtake uſually is bottomed upon a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding of that place of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.15. <hi>For that which I do, I allow not,</hi> &amp;c. Hence, ſay many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, graceleſs perſons, Why though they do break out into ſuch and ſuch things, and omit ſuch and ſuch duties, yet they do not allow themſelves in it; that is, their Conſcience is not wholly ſeared, and ſo make ſome reſiſtance, and this they take to be ſaving grace; a groſs and moſt dangerous miſtake; now take ſuch a perſon, and he hath <hi>not a delight in the Law of God in the inward man,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> had, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. doth not cry out as inwardly burthen'd, <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> No ſuch daily complaints and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under the weight of it, No eying God through Jeſus Chriſt for deliverance from it, No ſerving the Law of God with a <hi>Renewed</hi> inward Man, No
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:172030:91"/>
                           <hi>walking after the Spirit;</hi> ſo that unleſs it be ſo with you, that no allowance in the conſcience, and yet do it, it comes to nothing; and an Hypocrite may and doth as much, till given up to a ſeared conſcience, paſt feeling.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. From a miſtake of <hi>Faith,</hi> taking that for ſound and ſaving which is common to a Reprobate; ſuch as <hi>James</hi> deſcribes in his Epiſtle; ſpeaking of Men who ſay <hi>they have faith,</hi> and have not really; a Faith that believes God is; the Scriptures; the dying and riſing of Jeſus Chriſt, and all other Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truths, as it pretends; yea, that he believes on Jeſus Chriſt, and hopes to be ſaved by him, as well as the holieſt; and upon this they have a kind of peace. I have ſpoken before of juſtifying Faith, only a word as to the New-Creature, know therefore, that Faith that doth not teach a ſoul to <hi>deny it ſelf,</hi> that doth not <hi>purifie</hi> the heart, that doth not <hi>live</hi> upon Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo <hi>created into him,</hi> is not the faith of the New-Creature, but a common, dead, putrifying faith, that ſuffers the ſoul to putrifie in ſin, and works not to the cleanſing of it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. To inſtance in ſome other graces; as namely, <hi>Repentance,</hi> which ſouls do take to be only a wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſin had not been committed with a little fear and ſorrow after it, and this they think to be true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; which when true, is accompanied with loathing of the ſin, and our ſelves, and our corrupt natures, brokenneſs of heart for it, and from it, and turning to God by Jeſus Chriſt, and eyes the honour, patience, holineſs, love of God, in its ſorrowing, more than his wrath; and hath for its effects, <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, indignation</hi> againſt it ſelf, <hi>vehement deſire</hi> after more holineſs by Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="180" facs="tcp:172030:92"/>6. A falſe and carnal <hi>hope</hi> of Heaven, miſtaken for a gracious <hi>ſaving hope,</hi> deceives the ſoul in this matter: Many poor ſouls, yea, it may be feared, the moſt, think they ſhall go to Heaven, becauſe they <hi>hope</hi> ſo, and think they ought to hope: Now a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hope of pardon and Heaven is rightly bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd, namely upon the riches of Gods Grace, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.7. Upon the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5. Upon ſome ſpecial promiſe of God; Upon <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of God,</hi> Rom. 5. And <hi>purifying the ſoul,</hi> 1 John 3.3. as I may have occaſion more at large to ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>Oh! this falſe and carnal, curſed hope, that is not thus bottom'd, ſerves only to ſhut up the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the power of the Word, and a ſaving cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt; till a Soul is daſht in this hope, it will never get a better.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. A <hi>form of knowledge,</hi> eſpecially if <hi>increas'd</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Miniſtry of the Word, may much deceive a ſoul in this great and weighty concernment; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20. having <hi>a form of knowledge, and of the truth of the law:</hi> Many have a Catechiſtical form of Knowledge, they can deſcribe what Faith, and Repentance, and Regeneration is, and then think they have it themſelves, becauſe they can <hi>tell</hi> what it is, and do believe it to be ſuch: There may be much knowledge in the head, and yet no renewing grace in the heart: That knowledge that is ſaving, brings with it a power upon the Soul, to love, delight in, to experience the goodneſs, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſweetneſs of what it knows: It transforms the ſoul into the image of what is known, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> It is ſpiritual, and it makes the heart, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſpiritual.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. A Miſconceit of the <hi>grace of love,</hi> is alſo a falſe
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:172030:92"/>
ground in this matter: As that a poor ſoul will think that he loves God, when he hath no knowledge of him, nor delight in him, nor communion with him; nor doth love his Image, which is holineſs; and that he loves all, every one, whereas much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and malice reigns in the heart, if but a little provoked; and for the people of God truly ſo called, they hate them for Hypocrites, Schiſmaticks, and what not; or if a little better thoughts of them, 'tis not love to Chriſt, and his Image in them, that acts them, which is the nature of the grace of love. But yet are juſtified in their conſcience to be the people of God.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. So is patience, humility, meekneſs, miſtaken; ſome natural diſpoſitions are moſt patient and meek, and theſe poor Creatures are apt to miſtake for grace, when 'tis nothing but meer nature, and more candid diſpoſition; and ſuch Souls, from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temper can bear much, and it hath an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of of grace; but yet here may be no work of the Spirit all this while, humbling, meekning the ſoul in its own vileneſs, no mortification of contrary luſts, no humbling for pride of heart, without which no true gracious humility; no meekning by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the power of Chriſts love upon their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and yet upon this account, you ſhall have poor carnal ſouls pretend much (as I have often heard it urged by them) to the fruits of the Spirit, mention'd <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. of love, joy, peace, goodneſs, patience, temperance, when tis nothing but diſpoſition, inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, or from civil education.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. As great a deceit there is about the <hi>fear of God;</hi> many poor ſouls do fear the puniſhment and wrath of God, which is all they do, and then they think this is the fear of his Servant; the fear of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:172030:93"/>
Lord, which God promiſeth to put into the hearts of his own people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. is a fear of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is holy, becauſe he is gracious, becauſe he hath pardoned iniquity; <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs,</hi> Hoſ. 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> which fear is mixt with a ſweet and bleſſed love to God, and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, at leaſt a waiting for it.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. A <hi>miſapprehenſion of good works,</hi> cauſeth a miſtake of the New-Creature; many are convinc'd that works of Mercy, and Charity, and Juſtice, are to be done, and ſo from a pittiful nature, or from vain-glory, or from a ſecret thought to appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="12">12. Miſtake of a <hi>good converſation;</hi> which may only be a moral converſation, civil, ſober, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to Men, but minds not <hi>Holineſs</hi> to God, which is the ſpecial part of a Goſpel-Converſation: And yet the moſt of people go away with this, that they are believers, and in a good ſtate for Heaven, becauſe they have a good converſation, which they greatly miſtake. That which the word of God calls
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:172030:93"/>
a good converſation, as an evidence of Faith, is not only a meer outward blameleſneſs, (which the Phariſees had), but to walk with God from a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-principle, from Goſpel Grace, and the love of God in the heart, chiefly reſpecting holineſs to the Lord, and the fear of the Lord upon the heart; now a ſoul that hath nothing of this may be outwardly blameleſs, a Jew and Heathen may be ſo, and nothing of the grace of God upon them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>

                        <p>In a word, you may leave outward groſs ſins, have convictions of wrath to come, have purpoſes (ſuch as they are) to be better, take up to New Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have common grace, think you have Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, hope that you are humble, patient, have a good converſation, and do good works, and yet not be New-creatures in Jeſus Chriſt, as we ſhall further evince.</p>
                        <p>I have yet one more deceit to diſcover, and that is the Miſtake of a Scripture <hi>good conſcience:</hi> It is true, that the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5, 19. puts <hi>Faith and a good conſcience</hi> as the great comprehenſive Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but there is not any one thing more miſtaken, than what this <hi>good conſcience</hi> is; too many Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers preſs this carnally, and carnal people go away with it, that they have Faith, yea, they never doubt it, and for a good conſcience they diſcharge it; I have
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:172030:94"/>
ſpoken of Faith already, but now that which ſuch poor ſeduced ſouls take to be a good Conſcience, is only to wrong no body, to be juſt to all, not to purloin others goods, to take and keep nothing but their own; they take it to be chiefly converſant about the duties of the ſecond Table, concerning their Neighbour; a little to rectifie this ſoul-dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning miſtake.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A <hi>Scripture Conſcience</hi> is an <hi>Enlightned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> which before was ſhut up in darkneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. The light of the Word of God is ſet up in the conſcience, whereby it diſcovers thoſe truths in their power and worth which before it was dark unto.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A good Conſcience is a <hi>Conſcience ſearcht</hi> by the power of the Word, <hi>convinc'd</hi> to be under ſin, and guilt, and pollution, whereby trouble doth ariſe in it; God laying in the weight of guilt, the damnableneſs of ſin, the pollution of it, upon the Conſcience, ſo that the ſoul cries out, what ſhall I do? How ſhall God be pacified, and the ſoul ſaved?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. And hence it is an <hi>awakened Conſcience,</hi> which before was aſleep; <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi> Epheſ. 5. The voice of the Spirit doth awake that Conſcience that before was aſleep in ſinful ſecurity.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A good Conſcience is convinced that all the keepings of the Law, and keeping a Conſcience to men, cannot juſtifie the ſoul before God, cannot commend it to God, which a Second Table-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience imagines it will, and ſo in peace: <hi>Paul</hi> kept a Conſcience as to many things, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.1. <hi>I have lived in all good Conſcience before God unto this day;</hi> meaning, I conceive, from his youth up, when he was a Phariſee; but when his Conſcience was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:172030:95"/>
and awakened, and came to ſee Jeſus Chriſt, he ſaw that all his keeping a Conſcience, as to many ſins and Duties, could not in the leaſt commend him to God.</p>
                        <p>A good Conſcience is ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conſcience. How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spirit offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf to God, purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.14. So that this is the efficacy of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a Believer, it pacifies it in the ſenſe of the forgiveneſs of ſins towards God, ſo as it can draw near to God; and it <hi>purgeth</hi> it from dead works, ſin, and pollution, to ſerve God acceptably. This is a good Conſcience indeed.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>A good Conſcience reſpects all the Precepts of God,</hi> as well of <hi>Holineſs</hi> to God as Goodneſs to Men; which the Conſcience we have been ſpeaking of, doth not. Such a one makes not conſcience of this great and abſolute Precept, <hi>Be ye holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. It makes not conſcience of purging the heart of ſecret mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, of the purity of God's Worſhip: It makes no Conſcience of leſſer ſins, as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not of <hi>all</hi> ſin, as <hi>Herod</hi> heard the Word gladly, but made no conſcience of perſecuting <hi>John</hi> to death, when he ſtood in the way of his Luſts: Now, I ſay, a good Conſcience reſpects Precepts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>ſecret</hi> as well as publick Duties, inward as well as outward Sins, leſſer ſins as well as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. A Scripture good Conſcience <hi>is much taken up about godly ſincerity.</hi> So <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, that with

ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but with the grace of God, we have had our Converſation in the world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thus a ſoul that walks with a good Conſcience towards God, labours to approve it ſelf in all things, with a godly ſincerity, to do all as unto God.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, a good Conſcience labours to keep it ſelf pure and undefiled, it is accompanied with a <hi>pure heart,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. <hi>Now the end of the Commandment is love, out of a pure heart, and of a good Conſcience, and of Faith unfeigned.</hi> A Soul that would keep the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience good, would keep it pure, and the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man pure, as a Temple unto God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Now ſee how many ingredients go to make up a <hi>good Conſcience</hi> in a Scripttre-ſenſe, and what a great miſtake is in this weighty matter, and how far abundance of people that make conſcience of their dealings with men, conclude thence they have a Scripture-good-Conſcience to God, when they are not ſavingly enlightned, their Conſcience never ſearch'd by the power of the Word, and throughly awakened out of a natural condition, never hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for reſting in themſelves and their Duties, not having their Conſcience ſprinkled with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and purged thereby, not having a tender reſpect to all the Precepts of God, not to walk before him in godly ſincerity, nor with a pure heart: You then that are ſhort of theſe things, you are wholly to ſeek in that which you ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, and ſpeak peace to your ſelves in, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or keeping a good Conſcience; you have as yet no part in this matter.</p>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:172030:96"/>
Ones of Chriſt; how to preſerve the Conſcience good and peaceable, and ſo to live and dye in the peace and comfort of it, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Get it ſprinkled with the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt every day, and under the ſearching of the Word, and awake unto God, and pure and undefiled, reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting all the Holy Precepts of God, as binding to your conſcience, ſo will the conſcience be tender, and peaceable, and God will witneſs in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences your acceptance with him in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>I would give out further ſome Notes of Tryal, Whether you reſt in falſe common grace or not, as to what we have already ſpoken in ſo weighty a matter.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By your <hi>never ſuſpecting the truth of your grace,</hi> but taking all upon truſt, never doubting but you have Faith, and do repent, and ſo of all the reſt; that ſoul that never ſuſpected his grace, may well fear that his pretended grace, is no more than what a Hypocrite may reach unto: The poor called chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, are exceedingly jealous their Faith is not ſound; that they are ſhort in every grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the woful mixtures that they find; more Unbelief than Faith, more hardneſs of heart than ſoftneſs, more Pride than Humiliation; and ſo of all. Now that ſoul that goes away with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected confidence of every Grace, ſure flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters himſelf, and his way will be found to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That Soul that draws back his conſcience from the ſearching power of the Word, when it gives out ways of trial of Sincerity and truth of grace, and puts it off, as if not concerned in it; this may well be ſpeak a falſe heart. A gracious heart would
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:172030:96"/>
bring the Work over and over to the Touch-ſtone of the Word, delivers up it ſelf unto it; yea, is much with God to ſearch him, in point of a firm Work upon his Spirit, as to any prevailing Iniquity in his heart; as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 139. When he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, appealing to him, and opening his heart to him, ſpeaks thus, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Oh Lord thou haſt ſearched me,</hi> &amp;c. thou haſt: And yet, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.24. begs of God yet further to ſearch him: <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my thoughts; and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me into the way everlaſting.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Falſe Grace is diſcovered by its <hi>eaſie acting,</hi> When you can eaſily believe, eaſily repent, eaſily be humble, and ſo of all others. Certainly, 'tis all naught. There is great contradiction within, and from the Tempter, as to act Grace begun in a ſoul; yea, a daily ſupply from Jeſus Chriſt muſt be, to act any Grace livelily; which the common, pretending, eaſie Believers are not ſenſible of. It cannot be but every act of Grace muſt find more or leſs reſiſtance from fleſh and blood, which is ſo vigorouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the nature and acting of real grace in the Soul.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Such as are never humbled for the ſpiritual wickedneſſes of their hearts; (I call them ſo in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the more groſs and fleſhly wickedneſſes) now theſe are <hi>Hypocriſie, ſelfiſhneſs, ſpiritual pride, vain-glory, unbelief;</hi> many that have had trouble for ſome groſs ſins, and will withſtand ſome groſs corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, through common grace, never come to be abaſed for theſe depths of the heart, which are more hardly diſcerned; I may well enough call that ſoul as yet a Hypocrite, that is never humbled for the Hypocriſie of his heart, for ſelfiſhneſs, and the reſt.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="190" facs="tcp:172030:97"/>5. Common-grace meaſures the ſoul chiefly by <hi>Negatives,</hi> what it is <hi>not,</hi> rather than what really <hi>it is,</hi> as the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. — <hi>I am not as other men are;</hi> pleaſeth himſelf rather in what he is not than what he is: I am not thus and thus, as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of debaucht perſons are; but whether he be called of God, emptied of his own righteouſneſs, ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, a New Creature in him, he puts off the Examination.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Common grace doth at beſt <hi>reſpect a mans ſelf</hi> in all it does, and not the glory of God, which it ſees not; let others be as wicked as they will, it is not much to ſuch a ſoul, let every one look to himſelf, ſuch a ſoul doth not avoid ſin as ſin, but only for fear it ſhould damn him; whereas the proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Grace is to reſpect God, his Holineſs, Name, and Glory.</p>
                        <p>Thus have I laid down ſome plain Diſcoveries of the pretended New-Creature, that which I have ſtiled a <hi>Legal New-Creature.</hi> I ſhall now proceed a little further to make diſcovery of a more ſeeming Goſpel New-Creature, yet but ſeeming.</p>
                        <p>That which hath the neareſt reſemblance of the New-Creature, is, when from ſome <hi>common enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of the Goſpel of Grace, and ſome <hi>overly taſtings</hi> of the good Word, the <hi>affections</hi> being ſomething ſtirred therewith, there is ſome affection expreſſed to the Goſpel, and ſome outward Reformation upon it, and a Profeſſion above the common formal rate taken up, joyned alſo with <hi>common gifts</hi> of Praying, or Propheſying, knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now all this may make ſo great a <hi>blaze</hi> and flouriſh, that it ſhall be hardly diſcerned by ſuch a Profeſſor himſelf, or others that are ſpiritual; that all this may be, 'tis clear from ſeveral Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. where
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:172030:97"/>
mention is made of <hi>enlightning, taſting, gifts of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and yet ſuch to <hi>fall away,</hi> and <hi>never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new themſelves again;</hi> and <hi>to be nigh unto curſing,</hi> verſe 8. <hi>and</hi> verſe 9. <hi>Beloved we are perſwaded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things of you, and things that accompany Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> &amp;c. Implying, that theſe things may be, but do not always accompany Salvation: So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. ſpeaks of ſuch who had <hi>eſcaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet again entangled therein, and overcome, and their latter end worſe than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They ſhall eſcape many groſs pollutions, and that through a kind of knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet be again overcome, and return wholly to them. So <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.45. Our Lord Jeſus ſpeaks of the <hi>houſe ſwept,</hi> and <hi>garniſhed,</hi> the <hi>unclean ſpirit caſt out for a time;</hi> ſome outward reformation, a damp upon the luſts of the heart, and knowledge, and common gifts, and yet the unclean ſpirit returning again.</p>
                        <p>Examples might be produced of ſuch Profeſſors in the Goſpel, as that of <hi>Judas,</hi> an eminent Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, a forward follower of Chriſt, ſuffered ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and gifted, and yet proves a Reprobate. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus,</hi> baptized by <hi>Philip,</hi> renounced his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries, took upon him a forward Profeſſion of Chriſt, accompanied <hi>Philip,</hi> and yet <hi>his heart not right in the ſight of God,</hi> Acts 8.13, 21.</p>
                        <p>It may be more than feared, this age (to the high ſcandal of Sinners and Saints) hath produced many ſuch, that have been much taken with the glorious grace of the Goſpel, their Conſciences ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened for Heaven, the affections ſtirr'd, have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to flouriſhing gifts, and yet returned to their
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:172030:98"/>
firſt nothing, turn'd blaſphemers, and profeſſed <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And no doubt there is ſuch a Majeſty, Excellency, Sweetneſs in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, that may for a time much affect a carnal heart, and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved <hi>with joy,</hi> Matth. 13.20. The very Hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt dying for ſinners may much affect; that he will freely ſave Sinners, the glory he hath provided for his own, theſe and the like things may much take the affections for a time, make a ſoul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of groſs pollutions, and yet no New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all this while: And of ſuch as theſe it is that Chriſt doth propheſie of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. who ſhall have Lamps, Light and Profeſſion, go along with the wiſe Virgins, wiſe and truly gracious Profeſſors, not be diſcovered (many of them) till the Lords appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet kept out of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                        <p>Now of all others, theſe have the moſt reſemblance of a real New-Creature, and yet fall ſhort, and periſh for ever.</p>
                        <p>I ſhould prevent my ſelf, ſhould I at large diſcover wherein ſuch Profeſſors are ſhort, only a word or two.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Such Souls are never emptied of themſelves, and humbled, and ſo come poor and nothing to Jeſus Chriſt, though happily they may be able to ſpeak of it, as many Souls have a form of Goſpel-Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and can ſay, <hi>We are nothing,</hi> and yet never had the ſaving experience of it upon their own hearts.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such Souls have no <hi>true brokenneſs of heart for ſin,</hi> they much ſlight it; yea, ſay many, 'tis Legal; brokenneſs for ſin is a low diſpenſation, as they will ſtile it; without which (in ſome meaſure) no ſaving
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:172030:98"/>
repentance, which is as neceſſary to Salvation, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on Jeſus Chriſt, and Free-Grace.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Though ſuch ſouls may reform many things, yet there is ſome <hi>unſubdued luſt</hi> in the heart, that at laſt breaks out, and carries an end the heart, as with <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Demas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Under all ſuch enlightnings and taſtings which may for a time affect the heart, the heart ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains <hi>unchanged,</hi> and ſo no New-Creature.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. They are not rooted into Jeſus Chriſt, which we have ſhewed is the root of the New-creature; not <hi>rooted and built up in him,</hi> Col. 2.7. Therefore 'tis ſaid of the Hearers with joy for a time, that they had <hi>no root,</hi> Mat. 13.</p>
                        <p>What hath been ſpoken as to this, may put the more forward Profeſſors upon a cloſe and diligent ſearch, and to ſee if their Attainments in enlightning, taſting, knowledge, gifts, reformation, be no more than what a Reprobate may attain to, and to lay their hearts under the ſearching Power of the Word, and to open their hearts to God, and cry unto him, and keep a godly jealouſie over their ſpirits: And reſt not till you get poor and emptied, and humble your ſelves, your hearts broken for ſin, every luſt ſubdued and crucified, the heart changed, and your Souls rooted into Jeſus Chriſt, by a ſaving union with him; yea, to give up your hearts to what we ſhall further ſay, through grace, as to the plain opening the real Goſpel-New-Creature.</p>

                        <p>I Might here ſhew you how every faculty of the Soul is <hi>renewed,</hi> as the underſtanding, by the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of new and divine light into it, which is ſtiled the <hi>Enlightning the eyes of the underſtanding,</hi> Epheſ. 1.18. and to be <hi>renewed in the Spirit of the Mind,</hi> Eph. 4.23. How the will is altered and changed, the affections made new, the conſcience purged and ſanctified, with all the powers of the Soul, but I ſhall not take this Method, but rather purſue a more familiar way, more particularly ſhewing the make of the New-Creature, in reference ſtill to its being ſo in Chriſt, which is our principal ſcope. Firſt, then:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To the making and framing the <hi>New-Creature</hi> there muſt be a <hi>New-Nature;</hi> if there be a New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture formed, there muſt be a <hi>New-Nature</hi> to make it ſo; hence believers that are in Chriſt, are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. Which is wrought by <hi>the incorruptible ſeed of the word,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.22. Whereby we are ſaid to be <hi>born again:</hi> And <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſeed is the ſeed of God in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the ſeed of every grace in the ſoul, which is ſomething of the likeneſs of God wrought in the ſoul, and ſo acts the ſoul towards God, which is ſtiled the infuſed habits of every grace in the ſoul; this New-Nature works contrary to the old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and it is ſtiled the regenerate part, <hi>the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:172030:99"/>
new inward man,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24. and as ſoon as it is wrought and formed in the ſoul, it works againſt the ſinful diſpoſitions of the old <hi>Adam</hi> in us, and there is a new war or conflict begun within us, (which is ſomething more than the reſiſtance of a natural conſcience, as we have ſhewed) <hi>I ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Law in my members, warring againſt the Law of my mind,</hi> Rom. 7.23. <hi>&amp;c. The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe two are contrary to each other,</hi> Gal. 5.17. And under this daily conflict and war within is every New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, while we abide in the fleſhly Tabernacle. This is the firſt peculiar diſtinguiſhing Workmanſhip of the New-Creatures, there's a new ſeed, a new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature infuſed into the ſoul.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As there is a New-Nature, ſo it follows that this New-Creature hath a <hi>new life,</hi> it is a <hi>Living</hi> New-Creature; ſo regenerate perſons are ſaid to be <hi>quickned in Chriſt,</hi> who were before <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> Eph. 2.1, 5. And <hi>The dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and live,</hi> John 5. And they are ſaid to <hi>be alive unto God,</hi> Rom. 6.11. <hi>Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 20. Which new life muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be, becauſe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Every natural man, (as hath been already hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) is dead in ſin, and is ſaid to be <hi>without this life of God,</hi> Eph. 4.18. The life of God departed from the ſoul, whereby it had Communion with God, upon our fall in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> therefore, if we are recovered, we muſt have a new Life from God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into us.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If there be not a <hi>new life</hi> breathed in us, we can put forth no ſpiritual vigour in any duty towards God, and ſo all our duties, ſervices, worſhip would he dead fleſhly duties; this I have alſo hinted in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:172030:100"/>
ſhewing the neceſſity of being <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> if a New-Creature.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. As there is a new nature, and a new life, to begin the New-Creature; ſo, thence there's a <hi>new breathing:</hi> The Soul falls a breathing after God, and after Jeſus Chriſt: As the Life which God breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Man at his firſt Creation, is call'd the <hi>breath of life,</hi> Gen. 2.7. And as ſoon as ever there is life, this new life breath'd by the Holy Ghoſt in the New-Creature, there's preſently a <hi>breathing</hi> of this life, as indeed one of the firſt diſcoveries of it, (as breath is the moſt immediate acting of Life) the Soul <hi>breaths,</hi> and <hi>pants,</hi> and crys after God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the Water-brooks, ſo pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my ſoul after thee, Oh God: I opened my mouth and panted,</hi> Pſal. 119.131. So that Prayer that is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it is <hi>the breath of a living</hi> ſoul; <hi>Paul</hi> that breath'd out cruelties againſt the Saints, when converted, and made alive, he falls a breathing after God; <hi>Acts</hi> 9. — <hi>Behold he prayeth.</hi> And this doth indeed ariſe from the very nature of ſaving grace, which is to carry a ſoul to God through Jeſus Chriſt, to ſet it a longing not only after mercy, and pardon, and peace, but after God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. <hi>My ſoul is athirſt for God, the living God,</hi> &amp;c. As alſo from the diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and emptineſs the ſoul begins to find in all Creature-enjoyments, which now it cannot (having had a view of Chriſt) be ſatisfied and contented with, but the ſoul muſt have God, muſt have Jeſus Chriſt, muſt have the likeneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo it breaths, crys, pants after God, and the poſſeſſion of him, and communion with him, as the Souls higheſt perfection.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Now, therefore, before I go any further, let this be well weighed: Have you this <hi>breathing</hi> in you,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:172030:100"/>
which when you were dead in ſin you had not? This is the leaſt degree of Grace, if the Soul be not thus breathing, panting, thirſting, longing after Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that you cannot, muſt not be ſatisfied, but in the enjoyment of him; verily you are dead, and the grace of God is not in you; ſo that it may be for a true diſcovery of your ſtates, Conſider what your hearts do moſt breath after, what they moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly Pant for: Oh! Is it for Jeſus Chriſt himſelf? The hearts of Carnal Worldlings are ſaid <hi>to pant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the duſt of the Earth,</hi> Amos 2.7. That is it the carnal mans heart thirſts after, but a ſoul in Chriſt breaths upward, the Treaſures of Heaven it pants after, and will never be at reſt, till ſatisfied with them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This may ſerve to diſtinguiſh formal praying from that which is of the Spirit, in the Children of God. There's no ſuch thing as the breathing, pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, crying, longing of the Soul after God, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and Communion with him, in formal <hi>ſaying</hi> of prayers, the thing done quiets the Conſcience; but for God himſelf the Soul thirſts not for. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you that pray in forms in ſecret, and content your ſelves in ſaying and repeating ſuch a form of words, ſure you have little or no breathing for Jeſus Chriſt in ſuch Duties, the Heart is not exerciſed in longings and pantings for God; ye Souls that pray out of forms, upon terrours, and no more upon the Conſcience, but you thirſt not, breath not after God himſelf, you may be ſhort of the life of God in you.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This may alſo encourage weak Souls, that have but broken words to expreſs themſelves to God, yet your very Souls do breath and pant after the Lord, verily the life of Chriſt is in you, if it be
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:172030:101"/>
indeed ſo with you, and God will hear thoſe breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in you, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.56. <hi>Hide not thine ear at my breathings.</hi> The bleſſed God will not hide his Ear from the breathings of his poor Children.</p>
                        <p>Only let crying, panting Souls, take heed, that this breath be not ſtopt nor intermitted; 'tis a moſt dangerous thing to intermit the breath of Prayer, that it grows weaker and fainter; it will be a ſign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and a ſad one too, that the New-Creature is rather decaying, than encreaſing in you.</p>
                        <p>Be not contented with no more praying than will juſt, as we ſay, hold Life and Soul togerher; that is to live at a very low rate, but juſt to live, if that. As breathing takes in the Air, revives, enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Natural Spirits, renders the whole man lively and lightſom, and vigorous, ſo doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Spiritual breathing with God, and after God; it enlargeth the Heart, revives the Soul, keeps freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vigour of Spirit in the way of God; when God comes in with a full gale upon the ſoul, how ſweetly is it refreſhed, how doth faintneſs, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, indiſpoſition, go off, and the Spirit of a poor Creature is chearful with God, and bleſſedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights it ſelf in him. Oh, delight to be every where, in every way, where God breaths upon the hearts of his people, and where they breath after him.</p>
                        <p>And let new living Souls take heed by the way, how their hearts do pant after the Earth and World, and the contentments of it: This will as much damp Spiritual Life, and breath in the Soul, as any evil whatſoever: Lay your hearts to the fulneſs and ſweetneſs of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and breath ſtrongly for them, and thoſe things will be but wind and vanity.</p>

But I muſt proceed: I come now to ſpeak of the next diſcovery of the New-Creature, and that is, it hath <hi>new ſenſes;</hi> That you may ſee how fully it anſwers the frame of man, as a Living Creature, and what a New-Creation this is: As the New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath a New-Nature, a new inward life, and hath a new breathing, ſo it hath new Spiritual Senſes: So the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. ſpeaks of the <hi>Exerciſe of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Senſes.</hi> And as the Natural Life is exerciſed and preſerved by Senſes, ſo is alſo this new Spiritual Life of the New Creature, which I ſhall mention par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a <hi>New Ear</hi> given to this New-Creature: This Jeſus Chriſt hath frequently promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that he would <hi>open the deaf Ear:</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> 36.10. <hi>He openeth alſo their Ear to Diſcipline, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they return from iniquity. The hearing Ear, and the ſeeing Eye, the Lord hath made even both of them,</hi> Prov. 20.12. By this opening the Ear, is meant the opening of the Heart; as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Lydia, Act.</hi> 16. <hi>Whoſe heart the Lord opened:</hi> The heart is ſhut up naturally, and naturally cannot hear the <hi>voice of the Spirit,</hi> till the Lord himſelf open it. A natural man hears no more than the voice of a man, and the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Word, but when this <hi>New-Creature</hi> is formed, he is ennabled to hear the voice of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the voice of the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27. <hi>My ſheep hear my voiee.</hi> A Soul can then ſay, This the Lord ſpeaks to <hi>me</hi> in ſpecial; This is the voice of Chriſt that calls <hi>me,</hi> to come to him, and that Soul comes; Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks with a convincing, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, powerful Word, and the Heart being opened to receive it, obeys it as <hi>his</hi> voice: And ſo in every Ordinance, 'tis the voice of the Spirit of Chriſt the <hi>New-Creature</hi> waits for; <hi>He that hath an ear to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:172030:102"/>
hear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> Rev. 3. laſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>New-Creature</hi> hath a <hi>new ſeeing eye:</hi> The eyes of the Underſtanding opened, to ſee into the bleſſed and hidden myſteries of the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt; ſaith the Apoſtle of the Natural man, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. And, <hi>ſeeing, they ſee not,</hi> Matth. 13. But Chriſt ſpeaking of called Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee,</hi> &amp;c. They have a new ſight of God in Jeſus Chriſt, which ſight doth <hi>abaſe</hi> them, and alſo <hi>draw</hi> them to Jeſus Chriſt. The Vail being in part taken away, they can look into the things of God which they ſaw not before, the Scriptures begin to be unveiled, and they ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Letter of them, into the Life and Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of them. And thus the Lord Jeſus promiſed of old, eſpecially as to New-Teſtament-days, <hi>I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkneſs light before them, and crooked things ſtraight,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.16.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a <hi>new power of taſting</hi> given to the Soul, as another <hi>Spiritual Senſe,</hi> which before the Soul had to no purpoſe. A new and bleſſed taſting of the good Word of Life, <hi>Thy word is ſweeter than the Honey-Comb,</hi> Pſal. 19. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my mouth,</hi> Pſal. 119.103. <hi>If ſo be ye have taſted that the Lord is gracious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. there is a <hi>new taſt</hi> of the bitterneſs of ſin: <hi>The heart knows its own bitterneſs,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe-man: A <hi>Taſting</hi> of the ſpecial, free, and precious love of Chriſt: A <hi>taſting</hi> of the goodneſs of God in mercies. And thus there is a <hi>ſavoury ſpirit</hi> given to the New-Creature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he doth delightfully ſavour the things of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and can ſpeak ſavourly of them to others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="201" facs="tcp:172030:102"/>
                           <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Add to this a <hi>new ſmelling,</hi> to which the Spouſe of Chriſt often alludes in <hi>Solomon's Songs, Becauſe of the ſavour of thy good Ointments,</hi> Chap. 1.3. ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt, who is a new and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perfume to the Soul: <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderneſs, perfumed with Myrrh and Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe?</hi> Chap. 3.6. ſo ſaith the word of the promiſe, Chap. 4.6. — <hi>His ſmell ſhall be as Lebanon:</hi> And when Jeſus Chriſt breaths in his Ordinances upon bleſſed Souls, it is as ſweet and delightſom Perfume to them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fifthly,</hi> There is a <hi>new feeling</hi> wrought as an effect of this new life, which the Soul hath in Chriſt, when a new Creature is in him. The natural man is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling,</hi> as a dead man is; let never ſo great a weight lie on a dead man, and he feels not, but now take a Soul created into Chriſt, and he feels a new <hi>weight</hi> within him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. Sin is not only a burden, as to the weight of Guilt, but every corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (even when the ſenſe of guilt is removed by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt) is a <hi>Weight</hi> to the Soul, under which the Soul crys out, mourns, groans to be delivered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Sin hangs like a dead body about him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> If the Goſpel-New-Creature is a living new-Creature, and doth exerciſe <hi>Spiritual</hi> Life, and hath <hi>new ſpiritual ſenſes,</hi> Let this then be a word of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, to diſcover the ſtate of your Souls. Can you ſay, I that was dead, am alive? I was once ſpiritually dead, without feeling, did neither ſee nor hear nor taſt in a ſpiritual way; but now the Lord, in rich grace, hath opened my deaf ear, and my blind eyes, now I have heard the Lord himſelf ſpeak to my ſoul; now I have ſeen the Lord, and my heart is taken
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:172030:103"/>
with him: Now I ſavour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Word of Grace, and the Miniſtration of the Goſpel is a ſweet ſavour in Chriſt to me, the Name of Jeſus Chriſt is as <hi>good Ointment</hi> to me: Now I feel a body of ſin, and groan under it, and preſs after the deſtroying and crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Souls, If this be not your Experience, you are dead; your are without the Life of God, and Chriſt in you.</p>
                        <p>Oh! Go to God, Sinner, as you have been exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cry to him to <hi>open</hi> your ear to hear, and your eye to ſee: Be convinced, that as yet your Ear hath been ſtopt, as to hearing the Lord himſelf ſpeak to you. Oh ſay, Wo is me, that I am where the Lord uſeth to ſpeak, under the Miniſtration of his Goſpel, and yet he never ſpake to my Soul. Doth the Lord love me, and never ſpeak to me?</p>
                        <p>Pity, Lord, Pity a poor, deaf, blind, ſtupid, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury Wretch, and breath life into me; and then wait for the Lords Voice in his Word. Now let the Spirit himſelf ſpeak unto me, and unveil my heart, that I may ſee into the Myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, and may ſavour them upon my poor Soul.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let living Souls in Chriſt <hi>exerciſe</hi> their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Senſes, keep the <hi>Ear open</hi> to, and waiting for the Spirits Voice, be prying into the Myſtery of God in Chriſt, and all Goſpel-Truth, get a clearer ſight of Jeſus Chriſt, till you ſhall be infinitely taken with him, and love him for himſelf: And keep the heart ſavoury, and the precious ſcent of Goſpel-grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Spirits, and labour ſo to feel the weight of the body of ſin, how it poiſeth, polluteth, cloudeth the Soul, that you may come to that frame, to cry out to be delivered from it. And let it be abundant matter of Praiſe to the Riches of Grace, that God hath given life and ſenſes to your Souls, which he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:172030:103"/>
might have left under the death of ſin, to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The next Diſcovery of our Goſpel-New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is this, namely, He hath a <hi>new heart.</hi> So <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> Chap. 18.31. — <hi>Make you a new heart, and a new ſpirit,</hi> which the Lord hath in Free-grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the New-Covenant, <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give you:</hi> Which I ſhall preciſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſhew particularly wherein the heart is made new.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The heart naturally in its old, corrupt frame, is a <hi>Rebellious heart;</hi> Jer. 5.23. <hi>This people have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious heart:</hi> The uſual complaint of the Prophets. Now when the Lord makes the heart new, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to take away the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of heart, as it natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſeth the Word, Power, and Spirit of God, and the heart is made obedient and pliable to the Power of the Word, the Spirit's Teachings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.19. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, you ſhall eat the good of the Land; but if you refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be devoured,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My people ſhall be willing in the day of my power,</hi> Pſal. 110. The heart of it ſelf is ſtubborn, obſtinate, unwilling to ſtoop to the power of Truth, to yield to Jeſus Chriſt, but when it is made new, it becomes of a yieldable frame, to the practical Obedience of Goſpel-Truths.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The heart, as an effect of the former, is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>impenitent,</hi> Rom. 2.5. cannot mourn for ſin: But when 'tis made new, God makes it ſoft, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will take away the ſtoney heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you a heart of fleſh;</hi> which is a ſoft and tender heart, whereby a Soul can pour out its complaints to God: Yea, the <hi>heart will pour out it ſelf like water to the Lord,</hi> Lam. 2.19. The heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives impreſſions of truth, as by its ſoftneſs 'tis more
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:172030:104"/>
and more wrought to a new frame, as in the hand of the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Heart is naturally <hi>proud,</hi> and makes the ſinner <hi>ſelf-conceited,</hi> and well opinioned of his own condition, and will not ſuffer the ſinner to abaſe himſelf to God, and to take ſhame to himſelf: But, when a new work of God is upon it, the ſinner hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himſelf under the mighty hand of God, bears his reproach before him, and crys out, Oh! What ſhall I do for an humble heart? Lord, take away, ſubdue pride in a wretched Creature, <hi>James</hi> 4.10. Now he becomes a poor ſelf-emptied Creature, undone, helpleſs, and to a full Chriſt he at laſt goes.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Heart is naturally <hi>Hypocritical: The Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in heart heaps up wrath,</hi> Job 36.13. Now when God makes the Heart new, then it begins to be <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> in ſome good meaſure, for God; before the poor deceived ſinner thought he did all with a good heart, that he did bear much upon, that he did all with a good heart; but when God ſhews him his heart by the Candle of his Word and Spirit, then the poor Creature ſees what a Hell of Hypocriſie was, and is within him; that he acted in all his Duties, as from himſelf, ſo to himſelf, and not uprightly unto God: But when the Lord new frames the heart, then the Soul is after new, ſincere, holy aims for God in all it does, is moſt abaſed for ſelfiſh and hypocritical mixtures, and would account nothing well done, but as God is deſigned in it, and labours to walk in <hi>ſimplicity</hi> of heart, and <hi>godly ſincerity, as of God, and in the ſight of God,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 1.12.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The old heart is full of <hi>all uncleanneſs</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity,</hi> and cares not to be cleanſed: So ſaith Chriſt to the Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.27. <hi>Within you are full of dead
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:172030:104"/>
mens bones, (rottenneſs) and of all uncleanneſs.</hi> But now when the New-Creature is forming up, then the heart is after purifying; <hi>Purifie your hearts, ye double minded,</hi> James 4.8. Then what a bleſſedneſs would a pure heart be, ſaith a poor creature? Oh! that my heart were cleanſed! <hi>Waſh thine heart,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. Oh! that it were waſhed, ſaith the New-Creature! And this is one of the moſt ſpecial works a New-Creature will be after, as he is more formed up in Holineſs, to keep the heart pure, as a Temple for God.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Heart naturally is <hi>dead,</hi> as already hinted, and <hi>feels</hi> not its own <hi>deadneſs;</hi> but when renewed, then the <hi>heart doth live that ſeeks God,</hi> Pſalm 22.26. It feels, and mourns over its own deadneſs, and crys out, Quicken, Oh quicken me, Oh God! No Duty is well performed then, but as the Heart lives, in ſome meaſure in that Duty. Now it feels its own burdens, pollutions, luſts, corruptions, carnality, earthineſs, and bewails it before the Lord.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Heart is naturally divided between Chriſt and the World, Chriſt and Luſts, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10.2. <hi>Their heart is divided:</hi> But under its renewings, the heart, as to the main bent of it, makes a <hi>whole</hi> cloſe with Chriſt; the great buſineſs of a Soul then is, to give the whole heart up to Chriſt, and fears he can never do it fully and ſingly enough; and when the heart luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after other things, ſo far as it is renewed, it is fetcht in again to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The heart of it ſelf is <hi>unbelieving:</hi> Take heed <hi>leſt there be in you an heart of unbelief,</hi> Hebr. 3. Now when the heart is made New, there is a <hi>Work of Faith with power,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.11. And then the ſoul is made ſenſible of that bitter root of Unbelief, that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in their hearts, and they find it the hardeſt work
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:172030:105"/>
in the world, to believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſins, to fix on Promiſes, and that a believing heart is a ſpecial gift of God, and a work of the Spirit; which while a poor ſinner was ſhut up under Unbelief, he felt not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To <hi>unchanged</hi> perſons, who are the <hi>ſame in heart</hi> as ever they were; Oh, learn by what hath been opened, what is the natural make and frame of them: There is in you a Rebellious heart againſt the Lord, and wilful obſtidacy againſt his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and therefore 'tis that you caſt the Word of the Lord from you, and in your hearts deſpiſe it, and ſay, This is not the Word of the Lord, and we will not obey it: You have hard and impenitent hearts, and therefore you do not mourn for ſin; you have proud hearts, and are well-conceited of your condition, though damnable, and therefore you do not humble your ſelves to God; you have Hypocritical Hearts, and ſee it not full of Hell, of Uncleanneſs, dead in ſin, and without feeling, a heart divided between Chriſt and the World, unbelieving, and yet ſay, you have Faith: If thou canſt not make out a Newneſs upon thy heart, as we have ſhewed, thou haſt ſtill thine old heart, with its luſts, and thy eſtate is as yet dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, let thy Knowledge, Profeſſion, Outward-blameleſsneſs, be what it will.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Oh, therefore, let this Word be yet for further Tryal of your Eſtate. Can you ſay to the praiſe of free and rich Grace, that God hath in ſome meaſure taken away your <hi>Rebellious Heart</hi> from you, and you can ſtoop and yield to the power of Truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, that God hath made your heart ſoft in ſome meaſure, and the Pride of your hearts, in the falſe conceit you had of your ſelves, hath a ſtroak
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:172030:105"/>
from God upon it, that God hath ſhewed you your deep and curſed Hypocriſie, and how your heart was divided, and was wholly unbelieving; and that the Remnants of theſe wickedneſſes in you, of heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, hardneſs, pride, hypocriſie, pollution, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, are your greateſt burden, and you mourn over them daily.</p>
                        <p>If this be not your Experience, let that man or woman know, he or ſhe is a Hypocrite and Unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſees it not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Therefore, let it convince you, and exhort you to go and fall down before the Lord, and beg him to open your hearts (which naturally are ſhut up in Darkneſs) and to abaſe you in the ſenſe of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and that he would even do this for you in much Mercy, to take away a rebellious, hard, proud heart from you, and would make your hearts plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Word, and make them ſoft and humble before him, and to cloſe with the whole heart with Jeſus Chriſt, through a work of Faith upon you. Do this in the fear of the Lord, and through his Grace coming upon you, and ſee what God will do for you; and you will be your own wonders, that ever ſuch abominations ſhould lye hid in your hearts, and yet you not be confounded in your ſelves in the ſenſe of them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Let Souls that are through infinite grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome heart-renewings, know that they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done with this Work, till they come to Glory: Yea, Soul, thou haſt depths of <hi>rebellion, pride, hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, pollution, unbelief,</hi> which yet thou haſt not reach'd to; and therefore as thou muſt aſcribe all to Grace, for what the Lord hath done upon thee, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to thy greater humbling, how much adoe the Lord had with thee, to bring thy heart under ſo
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:172030:106"/>
much as it is; ſo to conſider, that the Candle of the Lord muſt more and more ſearch thy dark and deep heart, and 'tis to be thy daily work, or elſe all theſe evils will again much prevail upon thee.</p>
                        <p>Love therefore a ſearching Word from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt that are over you.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The next Diſcovery of the Goſpel New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is this; namely, <hi>The Goſpel New-Creature hath New Affections.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Briefly to inſtance in ſome of the chief.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The New-Creature hath <hi>new fear:</hi> The fear of an eternal Condition, that firſt uſually ſeizeth upon a convinced ſinner; the fear of a juſt and angry God againſt ſin; and, at laſt, upon its renewing, a holy, awful fear of God, as great, and holy, and good; a fear of ſinning againſt him, and that becauſe he is gracious. Naturally this affection of fear in a carnal heart is converſant about the loſs of outward things, about ſhame in the World, and the like; and ſo far as it reſpects God, his Soul, 'tis a ſlaviſh fear of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of ſome groſſer ſins only, leſt God ſhould damn him; but not fearing the Lord with a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Son-like fear, a fear that purifies the Heart, a fear that is mixt with a bleſſed <hi>love</hi> of God, and delight in his ways.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Heart is exerciſed with <hi>new Sorrow:</hi> A godly ſorrowing for ſin, ſuch ſins which were once the delight of the Heart; ſuch a ſorrowing that works an <hi>Indignation</hi> againſt the Darling ſins, a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a kind of <hi>Revenge</hi> of our ſelves for it, a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>deſire</hi> after pleaſing of God and Holineſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. There is a ſorrowing over a crucified Chriſt, and a ſorrowing after him; and well is a poor ſoul, when it can go in ſecret, and have this affection moſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:172030:106"/>
with ſighs, and groans, and tears, and ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There is a <hi>new joy</hi> by degrees inſtilled in the Soul, of which though there are various meaſures; to the Children of God, yet every New-Creature can go thus far, though not in that vigour of Spirit he would do, that (when the Spirit is free from great diſtempers) it can ſay, he hath ſome joy that he is deliver'd from the dominion and thraldom of luſts, that 'tis its joy to go before God; <hi>I will go unto God my exceeding joy,</hi> Pſal. 43.4. Even when under ſome diſquietneſs of Spirit; as verſe 2. <hi>Why doſt thou caſt me off?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Yea, will a poor ſoul ſay, God and Communion with him, (could I ſee his face) would be my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joy. And the carnal joy of the heart, when it breaks forth, leaves the ſoul but more in heavineſs, and the New-Creature would have his joy run ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Upon this the New-Creature hath <hi>New de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights:</hi> The Word of God becomes his delight, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the face of God and the People of God; <hi>Delight thy ſelf in God,</hi> Pſal. 37. And <hi>his chief delight is in the Saints,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. The heart cannot, as it could formerly, delight it ſelf in folly, and in vanity, and in vain carnal ways and people, but is rather bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with them.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The Soul is raiſed and engaged <hi>in a new Love:</hi> The Heart is taken with Jeſus Chriſt above all things, and loves him moſt; and loves God becauſe he is Holy, loves his Word, and loves thoſe that love him moſt: Every New-Creature can ſay, as <hi>David,</hi> I love the Lord, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18.1. and 116.1. Yea, the ſoul is brought to love Jeſus Chriſt for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; He is the beloved of the Soul, and not only
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:172030:107"/>
the grace, and peace, and bleſſing, and Heaven that he gives. And to Love Jeſus Chriſt, and to expreſs it to the utmoſt, is the frame of ſoul that a Convert preſſeth moſt after, and he would get the heart more purged, mortified, ſpirituallized, that it might go forth in Love to Chriſt more ſtrongly and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and enjoy the precious perfumes of his Love more conſtantly.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Soul is raiſed to a <hi>New hope;</hi> a new hope of Heaven and Glory, which before was feigned and deceitful: Now the Soul is after a well-bottom'd, real, lively hope of Heaven: <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again to a lively hope,</hi> &amp;c. Oh! the new and bleſſed hopes that a ſoul doth more and more reach to (when diſtempers and darkneſs is not upon it) of ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt as he is, living with him for ever, of being perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinleſs and holy, of Joys that ſhall be endleſs, of being ſwallowed up with divine Glory, when the Spirit of the Father doth breath moſt ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and moſtly raiſes the heart to glimpſes of Heaven.</p>

                        <p>If this be not thy caſe, but the affections of thy heart are wholly fleſhly and worldly; thy fears, thy ſorrows are about worldly things, thy joys, thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights about carnal pleaſures, and worldly increaſe, thy love goeth after the world in an uninterrupted, unmortified courſe, thy hopes going forth about great things for thy ſelf, and thy hopes for Heaven lye at all uncertainty, and thou doſt ſuffer it to be ſo; verily thou art unchanged, and haſt no part as yet in New-Creature-bleſſedneſs.</p>

                        <p>By the <hi>Thoughts</hi> I underſtand the pondering, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing part of the Mind, (that I may ſpeak plainly to all) the imaginations, fancies, purpoſes, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, muſings of the Mind of man, which are very much altered, where there is a <hi>new</hi> and divine work and power in the Soul.</p>

                        <p>In a natural heart, <hi>All the imaginations of it are evil continually,</hi> Gen. 5.6. <hi>They became vain in their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned,</hi> Rom. 1.21. Where the thoughts, as iſſues of the luſts, do rove to and fro at full liberty, without any effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual controul.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. As firſt, <hi>Atheiſtical thoughts;</hi> ſecretly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, his Juſtice, Holineſs, Word, or that God will not judge ſinners according to the rigour of his Word; <hi>Thou thoughteſt</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuch a one as thy ſelf;</hi> and Pſalm 50.21. <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God,</hi> Pſalm 14.1. For when he ſins againſt him preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, he doth ſtrike at his very Being, Juſtice, and Holineſs, and either ſaith in his heart, There is no God to judge him, or ſecretly wiſheth there were none.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Prophane thoughts,</hi> according to the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant luſtings of the heart, do act a natural heart; as vain, unclean, proud, worldly thoughts, which are in contrivance to make <hi>proviſion for the luſts</hi> of it, the heart even continually exercis'd with unclean, proud, wrathful, revengful, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous practices; therefore ſaith the Wiſdom of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.26. <hi>The thoughts of the wicked are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord: Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, Adulteries, Murders, Thefts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. The evil thoughts get up and act over wickedneſs, and then they purpoſe and contrive for the acting of it, and ſet the whole man on work to make proviſion, and to effect it; which though s being drawn forth by ſinful objects, or the working

                        <p>Now theſe being the natural actings of the thoughts of the heart as unchanged, there muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily enſue a new working of thoughts upon the change <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                        <p>A gracious heart hath bubling up of ſuch thoughts, and the Devil caſts in ſuggeſtions to ſet them a work, but they lodge not there long, but they are reſiſted and purged.</p>
                        <p>Take therefore theſe Notes of a carnal unchanged heart.</p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) Such a ſoul makes little or no conſcience of thoughts: Thoughts are free, ſay wretched ſouls, but that's a Proverb ſuggeſted by the Devil. (2.) Such a ſoul is not humbled, doth not mourn for wicked thoughts, but only looks to the outward man a little. (3.) Such a ſoul doth not bring them to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:172030:109"/>
the blood of Jeſus Chriſt to be purged. (4.) He doth not conflict with them, reſiſt, check, hate them. (5.) He doth not watch the thoughts of the heart, nor labour to ſet them upon holy Objects: If it be thus with thee ſinner, thy heart works wickedneſs, and thou art loathſom in the ſight of the holy God, who knoweth and obſerveth all thy thoughts afar off, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. and will one day reckon with thee for them: What doſt thou but even deny God to be the great ſearcher of hearts, the All-ſeeing God, who careſt not how vain, vile, wicked, unclean, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, loathſom, deviliſh, the thoughts of thy heart are?</p>
                        <p>But wherein doth this newneſs of thoughts ſhew it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The New-Creatures Thoughts are changed, as to himſelf; who thought well of himſelf, as to Heaven and Happineſs before, but now ſeeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vile, and hath worſe thoughts of himſelf than any one in the world can have of him.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He hath <hi>new thoughts of</hi> God: New thoughts of his Holineſs, and Juſtice, and Greatneſs, and Glory; Oh! how great is God, how holy, how juſt; and ſo is greatly abaſed before him. He hath new thoughts of his goodneſs, grace, and love to poor ſinners, upon which the thoughts do much work, thoughts of admiration and praiſe, and the ſoul delights in holy and gracious muſings of it.</p>
                        <p>He hath <hi>New Thoughts</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, of his Perſon, Grace, Blood, Righteouſneſs, Spirit, Word, People. Before he had poor, low, empty, carnal, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury thoughts of Chriſt, but the heart being chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Mind enlightned by the Holy Ghoſt, the Thoughts work towards Jeſus Chriſt, the Soul

hath deep and ſerious thoughts of his grace and love, precious thoughts of him.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. He hath <hi>new thoughts of Eternity,</hi> of an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condition, which much poſſeſs the Heart what may become of his Soul: What will it profit to gain the World, and loſe his ſoul? How he may treaſure up for Heaven, make ſure work for Heaven, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be his condition in this world; and the ſerious and frequent thoughts of this, do much poize the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Believer.</p>

Oh take heed of giving way to, and feeding vain, unclean, unholy thoughts of any kind, and let me preſs it upon you with theſe Motives.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Conſider, that <hi>ſuch thoughts are your ſins,</hi> lay that to heart.

Oh, did a gracious Soul ſtill conſider this, that the jealous Eye of God is upon every thought and motion of his heart to ſin, it would make him look cloſely to the Thoughts of his Heart.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Conſider, that evil thoughts and muſings of ſin, are the beginning of all open wickedneſs, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.

                        <p n="4">4. <hi>They do defile the ſoul,</hi> Mat. 15.20. <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Theſe are the things which defile a man:</hi> Which defilements unfits the ſoul for communion with God; they make a filthy pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the Soul and what a caſe is a poor Creature in to come to God, in Duty, in ſuch a pickle.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Evil Thoughts do <hi>pervert the Heart</hi> from God, which ſhould be <hi>fixed</hi> upon him; they draw away the ſtrength of the heart from God; they ſuck up the juice and marrow of the heart, which ſhould be ſpent in ſpiritual things in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Such Thoughts do <hi>grieve the Spirit:</hi> Nothing more; the Spirit cannot delight to teach and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when the heart is moſtly acted by fooliſh and unholy Thoughts.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. When ſuch Thoughts are acted in the Soul, God may <hi>leave you to the power of them,</hi> to break out to ſome grievous fall, and ſo may ſhip-wrack your peace and comforts for a great while, and go with broken bones, and it may coſt you much bitterneſs, before you are healed.</p>

                        <p>Now, not one of theſe Conſiderations, but may make a Child of God to tremble, how he lets forth his heart into vain, carnal, idle, defiling thoughts and muſings, which do ſo much waſt a gracious Spirit, and lay him open to ſuch woful dangers as theſe are.</p>
                        <p>To help a Child of God in this ſpiritual Work of looking to, and a holy ordering the Thoughts of his Heart.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Delight thy ſelf much in the Word of God, not only in Publick Hearing, but Daily Reading; and not only Reading, but <hi>getting ſome good word upon thy heart,</hi> that may <hi>ſeaſon</hi> thy thoughts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Saith <hi>David, I hate vain thoughts, but thy Law do I love,</hi> Pſal. 119.113. The love of the Word of God made him be ſo far from cheriſhing vain Thoughts, that he did <hi>hate</hi> them. It doth appear this was a ſpecial part of <hi>David</hi>'s exerciſe of Spirit, to get ſome bleſſed Word upon his heart, and he thinking of it, and ſo it did turn into the ſweet and wholeſom nouriſhment of the New-creature: <hi>Oh how I love thy Law, it is my meditation all the day:</hi> Bleſſed and holy practice, worthy a gracious Saint indeed; you have one word eſpecially that <hi>David</hi> had much on his heart, out of the Books of <hi>Moſes;</hi> (for we know not whether any other Scripture were then exant) 'tis that of <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. where the Lord ſaith, he will proclaim his Name and Glory: <hi>The Lord God merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſs and truth,</hi> which you have in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.15. and 145.8. Happily one of thoſe ſweet words which he often magnifies: How hath a ſingle word dwelt upon the heart of a Child of God, and hath kept the heart ſavoury for Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The next Remedy againſt ſuch Thoughts, is, <hi>Much Prayer,</hi> diligence, fervency, pouring out the heart to God, till the heart melts, and runs forth ſweetly, ſpiritually, and is engaged with God, and

hath a ſight of him, and a divine impreſſion of God's Majeſty left upon the ſoul.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Get more and more <hi>brokenneſs of heart for ſin;</hi> when the Heart hath been broken, 'twill not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily get into Vanity again: At leaſt, a Child of God ſhould take care that it ſhould not; when the heart is broken and mourning, the Spirit doth wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that work refine the heart: All the ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vanity, defilement, diſtraction, that comes upon the New-Creature, is moſtly for want of this.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. <hi>Mortification of that Corruption</hi> that is moſt apt to ſtir, doth much cure our thoughts: Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Affections are the Saints greateſt Evils, and do beſpeak an unmortified heart, as to what a Child of God ſhould ſtill be preſſing after, even to be dead, and crucified with Chriſt. <hi>Thoſe that are Chriſts, have crucified their Affections and Luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.22.</p>
                        <p n="6">6.

run forth in the ſweet and bleſſed apprehenſion of the preciouſneſs of Gods thoughts in him, from all Eternity, and in the ways of his Covenant towards him: If Gods thoughts to us be holy, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ever towards us, the thoughts of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould be ſo alſo, and as little common and unſavoury as may be.</p>
                        <p>More particularly, let us yet conſider what bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and excellent, and glorious things, ſuch as are New-Creatures in Chriſt have, to exerciſe their thoughts about.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Gracious Souls have the Attributes of God to exerciſe the thoughts of their Hearts in; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs of God, his Greatneſs, Holineſs, Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A bleſſed Exerciſe for Saints indeed! So we find the Scripture-Saints ſweetly taken up with contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and admiration of the Excellencies of God himſelf; <hi>Thou art glorious in Holineſs,</hi> Exod. 15.11. ſaith <hi>Moſes.</hi> But <hi>Thou art holy,</hi> ſaith David, Pſal. 22. <hi>Oh how great is thy Goodneſs!</hi> Pſalm 8.31. as might be abundantly ſhewed; and the exerciſe of the thoughts this way, hath a powerful influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Heart, as to its <hi>abaſement, purity, ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2.

We have <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s hearts ſwallowed up in this above any other; as <hi>David</hi> in many Pſalms is in the admiration of grace, and <hi>Paul</hi> in moſt of his Epiſtles makes it his great ſcope, as the great Argument, to be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

believing, but humble and holy, and heavenly, all their days, eſpecially <hi>Col.</hi> 1. and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1ſt. 2d. and 3d. Chapters.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Saints have the unſearchable Riches of Jeſus Chriſt to take up their thoughts with, the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Dignities of his Perſon, the Beauty and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that is in him, the depths of his love, the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs price of his blood, his bowels to ſinners, his care of his Churches: Oh theſe are things worthy the thoughts of Saints indeed!</p>
                        <p n="4">4. They have to take up their thoughts, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bleſſedneſs of the forgiveneſs of their ſins: What a bleſſed ſtate, a ſtate of forgiveneſs in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt is! <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> Oh bleſſed for ever, <hi>are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven!

                        <p n="5">5. Such as are New-Creatures in Chriſt, they have <hi>the Myſtery of the New-Covenant,</hi> the everlaſtingneſs of it to bring their hearts to, and <hi>to work the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> thereof upon their hearts, to muſe on the returns of their Prayers, to behold the continual Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God towards them, and his ways of mercy and kindneſs to them.</p>

nothing elſe but love him, enjoy perpetual commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, be praiſing, admiring, adoring the bleſſed Majeſty of God for ever and ever.</p>
                        <p>Oh! If there are ſuch excellent and bleſſed things, for the thoughts of the holy-ones of God to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in; Oh! what baſe Dunghil hearts have ſuch that pore upon nothing but earth and filth.

                        <p>And do not ſuffer the Devil to take up his abode, by his ſubtle and ſudden ſuggeſtions, or more cloſe inſinuations upon you.

                        <p n="8">8. The Eighth Diſcovery of the New-Creature is this,</p>
                        <p>The New-Creature hath a <hi>new Lip,</hi> a <hi>new Tongue,</hi> let looſe to ſpeak of God, and for God: And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I ſhall a little inſiſt upon: Saith our bleſſed Lord, <hi>A good man out of the good Treaſure of his heart bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good things,</hi> Matthew 12.35. Good, and wholſom, and ſavoury Words: To this we find the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures often preſſing; ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.15. <hi>The Lips of knowledge are a precious Jewel; The mouth of a righteous man is a well of Life; The lips of the righteous feed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Prov. 10.11, 12. So the Apoſtle; <hi>Let no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt communication proceed out of your Mouth, but that which is good, to the uſe of Edifying, that it may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter grace to the hearers,</hi> Epheſ. 4.29. <hi>Let your ſpeech be always with grace, ſeaſoned with ſalt,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 4.6. By which places 'tis evident that a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial diſcovery of the New-Creature is herein mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The New-Creature hath a <hi>New Tongue</hi> to ſpeak <hi>Savourly</hi> and <hi>Experimentally</hi> of the things of Chriſt, and the work of the Spirit, Becauſe that which the heart is exerciſed with, it will be bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh; an evil man out of the abundance of evil in his heart bringeth forth evil things, as a good man doth good things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.25, 28. If the heart and affections be ſpiritually exerciſed, the Tongue will be ſpeaking forth.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="225" facs="tcp:172030:114"/>2. Becauſe thereby a New-Created Soul doth give glory to God; they ſpeak of the Teſtimonies, works, goodneſs, grace, and the wonders of the Love of God to poor ſinful Creatures: And hereby God is much glorified; <hi>Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will tell what he hath done for my Soul,</hi> Pſal. 66.16.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Gracious hearts <hi>do</hi> hereby <hi>ſtir up the Grace of Chriſt in them;</hi> 'tis like the blowing of a ſpark, and makes the heart to glow e're it is aware; gracious Conference is the very breath of the Spirit, which kindles all our Graces afreſh; as it was with the Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> Luke 24.32. <hi>Did not our hearts burn within, while he talked with us by the way.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. Good Souls do not only profit themſelves, in receiving good, but they profit others; one of the beſt ways that we do good, is in profiting weak Saints or Sinners; how hath a word ſpoken from a ſavoury perſon, humbly and wiſely, dropt in upon the Soul of a ſinner, which hath been its firſt awakening. And ſo upon a poor weak tempted Child of God, how ſeaſonably hath God ordered a word for a poor ſoul from conference with another!</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:172030:115"/>
Believer, or falſe and dead Faith, <hi>James</hi> 1.26. <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is vain.</hi> 'Tis but a <hi>ſeeming</hi> to be religious, a <hi>vain</hi> Religion, where the tongue hath a carnal Liberty; and he calleth the Tongue <hi>a world of iniquity, ſet on fire of Hell,</hi> Jam. 3.6. <hi>an unruly evil, full of deadly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> ver. 8. The evils of the Tongue that beſpeak a ſinner unregenerate, are theſe; and they are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent among this generation.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Speaking evil of the Spirit of God,</hi> and ways of God, and People of God: Oh, ſuch, ſay they, have the Spirit, that they be Holy, and they are ſo ſtrict that they will not do ſuch and ſuch things as others do: This is a degree of Blaſphemy, and borders up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the brink of the unpardonable Sin. Theſe are ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Apoſtle <hi>Revilers,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.11. &amp; 6.11. and they, as ſuch, <hi>ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The giving out of the Spirit upon plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, in the meaſure it now is, <hi>is a new thing,</hi> but not therefore to be deſpiſed and reviled.</p>
                        <p>Every Town and Family almoſt doth abound with this wickedneſs and dreadful provocation, and 'tis the ſaddeſt ſign upon the generality of people what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; only, 'tis to be hoped, they do it through <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. and God, as he hath done, may humble and convert many of them, to the praiſe of his Grace; only let ſinners that have been frequently ſhewed the deſperate wickedneſs of ſuch ſpeeches, of ſcoffing at the Spirit and Holineſs, and call it Hypocriſie, tremble leſt God give them up, when they ſin againſt Conviction, and the clear light of the word in this matter.</p>
                        <p>Had I time to reaſon a little in the power of the

Lord, with ſuch ſouls; why, Conſider ſeriouſly and in good earneſt, Can you be ſo ſottiſh, and ſo wilfully blinded, that have heard or read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to imagine that you are God's and Chriſt's, and <hi>have not the Spirit,</hi> and are not made <hi>Holy,</hi> nor crying to God that you may be holy? <hi>He that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt is none of his;</hi> And, <hi>without Holineſs you ſhall not ſee the Lord;</hi> How dare you then, in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and deviliſh wickedneſs of your hearts, ſcoff at the very Name of the Spirit and Holineſs! The loweſt place in Hell will be yours, that have been ſo often admoniſhed of this, unleſs God ſmite you to the Earth for it: True Converts have the ſaddeſt Humiliation for this ſin, as they have been more or leſs guilty of it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Or you that are not ſo deſperately carried forth in this open ungodlineſs, of ſpeaking evil of what you know not, but yet make little Conſcience of lying for your profit, or in excuſing a matter, ſo you may do it covertly, and count, it a venial ſmall ſin; or you, that when provoked, ſwear prophanely, and deſperately, tearing the Name of the great and dreadful God, wreaking your anger and wrath upon the Name of God, and the blood of Chriſt; your Tongues are ſet on fire on Hell, and the Spirit of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, the Devil worketh in you; not a drop of the Grace of God in you.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Or you who have your <hi>petty Oaths,</hi> by your Faith, by your Lady, and by Creatures, or make mention of the Name of God, and Lord, in your ordinary Diſcourſe, vainly, and as a by-word, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oh Lord, upon every ſlight occaſion, and for <hi>God's ſake,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt's ſake</hi> do this, and this, in poor trivial matters; verily there is nothing of the New-Creature in you: And yet theſe great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſes

you call your infirmities, and 'tis your infirmity to ſwear, when angry and provoked, and you ſay you forget your ſelves, when you menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Name of the Lord God ſleightly, or through Ignorance plead for it, that you may do ſo; I tell you, Souls, they are your reigning, damning ſins, who are frequent in them: And in carnal prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs families, as moſt are, how oft in a day may theſe ungodly ſpeeches be heard, by men, women and children? If the fear of God were upon you, or any work of Grace, you durſt not do it, nor indeed could do: Therefore do but obſerve your ſelves a day, and ſee how often you are here guilty, and tremble before God, and go and humble your ſelves at his feet, that you may find mercy, and have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heart and mouth given unto you: Pray, and cry, and wait for the good treaſure of the Word of Grace in your hearts, and 'twill be otherwiſe with you.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Yea, you who are engaged in <hi>worldly Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath</hi>-day, in your families, at your doors, in the ſtreets, in idle and vain jeſting; you are not of God, born again by his Spirit, you take no delight in the Word of God, the meditation of your heart is not in it, you ſpeak little of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſavour it not. Tremble you Worldlings, who ſhew it this way, at that Word, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.5. <hi>They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them:</hi> If ye are of the world, you are not, as yet, of Jeſus Chriſt, the power, love, of this preſent World ruleth in you, and that may damn you for ever.</p>
                        <p>Know, ſinners, you that make little Conſcience of vain, prophane words, (though you pretend to make ſome conſcience of your word of promiſe to Men, for

your credits ſake, and ſo think you have grace, (all which a <hi>Turk</hi> will do) that by your words you ſhall be judged; and of <hi>idle words you ſhalt give an account at the day of Judgment; and by thy words thou ſhall be condemned,</hi> Mat. 12.36, 37. Such words as we have opened, to be damning ſins. And therefore, do not put off this guilt from you, in ſaying, 'tis your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and ſo make light of it; but know, 'tis guilt which will ſend you to Hell, if the Lord humble you not, and change you.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a certain Rule, a prophane heart, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane mouth, a carnal heart, a carnal tongue, a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart, a worldly (yea Sabbath-days) tongue: Therefore, you are not New-Creatures in the leaſt; and therefore begin with the heart, that the heart may be ſmitten of God for this ſin, and changed, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the word and grace of Chriſt upon you; and it will be better with you, and you will have a tongue to ſpeak well of the Spirit, and the things of God, and his People; and to ſpeak for God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently of his Name, and delight your ſelves in it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let this be a word to ſuch, as through grace are become New-Creatures in Chriſt, that you would ſhew it in this diſcovery, in a <hi>new Tongue,</hi> that you give not your ſelves that liberty of vain, carnal, much leſs prophane Diſcourſes, as formerly; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you will not, if you be new Creatures. Men's Converſe do either lye among ſuch as are wholly carnal and worldly, or ſuch as ſavour that which is good.</p>
                        <p>As to the former; as in all our carriage, ſo eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in our Words, there is great caution to be had.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="230" facs="tcp:172030:117"/>1. Not to mix our ſelves with them unneceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unleſs we find we have ſtrength enough, through a dependency on the Lord, to avoid their ſnares, and do it with a purpoſe of heart to do them good, by reproving or counſelling them. Many a good ſoul hath been ſadly worſted by mixing unneceſſarily with vain, prophane or frothy company.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If Providence caſt thee amongſt them, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it may be the Wiſdom of a Child of God to <hi>keep ſilence;</hi> as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39.1. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my ways, that I ſin not with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle, when the wicked is before me:</hi> I ſay, it may be ſometimes beſt for a Child of God to do ſo; there's a ſecret conviction goes forth, by the ſilence of a ſervant of God oftentimes, and to have them as ſoon as we can, ſo it be not done ſcornfully, but humbly and civilly: I do not mean a total ſilence, but a wearineſs.</p>
                        <p>When you are caſt among carnal perſons, as to your Callings, neceſſarily, Take heed of giving your ſelves a full liberty, multiplying of words unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, but be reſerved and watchful; that by any thing you ſay, or indeed any other carriage, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you converſe with, be more hardned in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal courſe, or be offended more againſt the ways of Godlineſs; which, indeed, a Child of God ſhould moſt heedfully conſider in all his ways: Oh, 'tis a bleſſed and gracious deſign, rather to better than worſt all we converſe with.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If you have a heart (as you are to look up to God for a heart) to reprove what may be reprovable, (as often it may be your duty) or to commend the ways of God unto them, to render them acceptable and precious, and comfortable, or any good word of

                        <p n="2">2. <hi>With meekneſs:</hi> Not ſharply, nor raſhly, nor proudly, nor cenſoriouſly, but with a <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> ſpirit, — <hi>ſhewing all meekneſs to all men,</hi> 2 Tit. 2.

                        <p n="2">2. If Providence caſt you among God's People, (as this indeed ſhould be our choice) 'tis not well to part from each other without ſomething of God, his Word, Grace, Goodneſs, Providence, People, their own Hearts, Temptations, Comforts, according to what is upon their Hearts, or what they conceive may be of beſt uſe to thoſe we ſpeak to, conſidering their condition, or temptations, or falling ſhort, or in what, if ſtronger Chriſtians, we may our ſelves be helped and encouraged; and not to give way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition or temptation, or fear we ſhall ſpeak as Hypocrites, (which is ſometimes a ſnare) but to have a <hi>ready mind</hi> and chearful delight to do it: Not but

the people of God may in due ſeaſon ſpeak of their Callings, and of Affairs and Occurences in the World; yea, and ſometimes that which may beget chearfulneſs, ſo we watch our hearts in it, and take heed of an uncomely inordinateneſs in it.</p>

Do not follow <hi>your fancy,</hi> in ſpeaking what it ſtill dictates, but <hi>your judgment:</hi> Many good men too too much follow a working fancy, though there may be a ſober chearful Exerciſe of it in ſeaſon; but we are too apt to run forth to exceſs: The Devil will kindle Squibs upon the Fancy, which we muſt rather quench than feed and bring forth.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Keep ſome good thing upon the Heart;</hi> ſome good Word you daily take in, as was directed as to your Thoughts, ſome comfortable Experience of God, the ſenſe of what you received in an Ordinance,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:172030:118"/>
that you may diſcourſe of the Word laſt heard, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.1. <hi>My heart is enditing of a good matter, my Tongue is the Pen of a ready Writer:</hi> Oh bleſſed, when 'tis ſo with gracious Souls: <hi>I muſe on the works of thy hands,</hi> Pſal. 143. <hi>My meditation of God ſhall be ſweet,</hi> Pſal. 104.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>Pray for a good frame of heart, and keep it ſo:</hi> Pray till the heart be made tender, ſavoury, quickned, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged with the ſenſe of God's Majeſty, Holineſs and Goodneſs upon your Spirits, and then watch to keep them ſo; a ſavoury Heart, and a ſavoury Mouth.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Be not provoked by the vain and frothy Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of others, though they may be good men, to comply with it: We are too apt to take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that which may be evil, becauſe 'tis the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty another good man takes, which is often a ſnare.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Keep the fear of the Lord upon thy Heart, a holy awe of God and his Preſence, one of the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Duties of a Saint, eſpecially in this matter. The fear of God makes the Spirit ſerious, and yet mixt with comfort and a comely chearfulneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Stand in awe of God, and ſin not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I might alſo lay down Motives to this choice Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: It doth much pleaſe and delight the Spirit of God; it brings in much good to the ſoul: Gracious conference is an Ordinance of God, and bleſt to the quickning, eſtabliſhing, ſuccouring, and refreſhing the hearts of Saints. Accuſtom your ſelves to it, and you will find indiſpoſitions wear off, and you will do it out of a ready mind, and gracious delight: Only, be not only a talker, from Notions in the Head, nor affect a diſputing, wrangling Knowledge,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:172030:119"/>
(uſually the effect of Pride) but do it from Heart-experience in ſome meaſure; or what you would fain get more upon your hearts: And let it not be only a talking-knowledge, but an humble walking-knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Remember, to thy continual abaſement, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinners thou haſt helped Hell-ward, by thy lewd, vain, prophane ſpeeches, by thy reviling at the Lords ways and people, and how thou haſt encouraged and hardened them this way in ſin. Oh, now let thy work be, through infinite grace, to tell ſinners, that there is more good infinitely in Jeſus Chriſt than in the way of folly. Now draw as many as thou may'ſt, according to thy meaſure of grace, to Jeſus Chriſt, and Heaven-ward.</p>
                        <p>And thus much be ſpoken of this Diſcovery of the <hi>New-Creature,</hi> in its ſhewing it ſelf in a new Lip.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The 9th. Diſcovery of the New-Creature.</p>
                        <p>Such as are New-Creatures in Chriſt, they will have <hi>New-Company.</hi> As ſoon as a ſoul is new forming up in Chriſt, he ſaith, as <hi>David, Depart from me ye evil doers, for I will keep the Commandments of my God,</hi> Pſal. 119.115. <hi>Depart from me all ye workers of Iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping,</hi> Pſal. 6.8. <hi>I am a Companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts,</hi> Pſal. 119.63. So the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Saints, as ſoon as converted, they become <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions</hi> of the reproached Ones of the Lord, and <hi>took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods</hi> with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. And ſo <hi>Moſes choſe affliction with the people of God,</hi> before Riches and Honour with the Prophane, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26.</p>
                        <p>Now this real Converts do:</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="235" facs="tcp:172030:119"/>1. Becauſe wicked and carnal men will act and ſpeak wickedly againſt God, and his ways and people; which a heart broken, and made tender, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to hear and obſerve: <hi>David</hi> ſaid, it was like a <hi>ſword in his bones,</hi> Pſal. 42.10. when wicked men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Lord and his ſervants.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Converts are <hi>in great danger to be tempted to ſin,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s houſe, by the company of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and carnal perſons; the Devil will lay ſnares, eſpecially for weak Souls: It will be hard for weak ſouls to paſs without guilt, by mixing with them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Saints <hi>will contract deadneſs and indiſpoſition</hi> by their company; it cauſeth old Luſts to ſtir, and other ſins of heart to be working. The carnal part will be too ready for complyance with them; how hard to come off from them, not worſted.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Such as are New-Creatures in Chriſt, have quite <hi>different Spirits</hi> from wicked and carnal men, <hi>different principles, different ends,</hi> and therefore they muſt needs avoid them, and cannot take ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and contentment with them, unleſs under great temptation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To ſinners unconverted, who take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in your carnal, merry company, but are burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the company of godly, and you ſecretly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain them, and the Devil ſuggeſts to you, that they are Hypocrites; know this, and be aſſured of it, and your Conſciences muſt acknowledge it, that ye are yet in your ſins, and haters of Holineſs, and you love not the appearance of it: Certainly, you are none of theſe New-Creatures, and you cannot know your ſelves by a better Character, than by the company you moſt delight in. You do not make choice of your moſt intimate company by their Godlineſs, but
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:172030:120"/>
from wordly ends, or mirth, or good fellowſhip, as you ſtile it, or generoſity, or ſome ſuch carnal end; verily, the grace of God is not in you, and your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is damnable.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As ever you would find mercy, look up to the Lord to turn your hearts to himſelf, and then to thoſe that fear him: Break off from your vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who engage your hearts to vanity: What ſaith the Wiſdom of God, <hi>A Companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> Prov. 13. No ſuch fools (how witty, or prudent, or civil ſoever otherwiſe) as carnal ſouls, that delight in vanity; Oh hearken to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the wiſe, and your ſoul ſhall live. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this is the hardeſt pluck in converſion, but yet it muſt be done, with a vigorous reſolution, through grace; when once the bands are broken, and you come to find, as you will, abundant more ſweetneſs in the Lords ways, verily you ſhall never repent your ſo doing.</p>
                        <p>And ſuch as have ſome deſires towards goodneſs, and have ſome better thoughts than you have had formerly of good people, you will make little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in grace, and peace, and comfort to your own ſouls, till you do this; till you can abhor your ſelves for your vanity and prophaneſs among carnal men, and can with full purpoſe of heart cleave to the Lord, and overcome fear or ſhame, or whatever ſuch curſed evils that are in your way, and all your rocks of offence, you will make little of it as to evidence any ſound work in your hearts, and peace with God by Jeſus Chriſt; one days accompanying with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, will ſet you more backward in the matter of godlineſs, than many days after will help on.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Let ſuch as would evidence the New-Creature, be very watchful in this matter, and not to touch
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:172030:120"/>
pitch, leſt they be defiled; mix not your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily, as hath been exhorted in the laſt head, among carnal men, unleſs you have a good and holy end in it; ſo as Jeſus Chriſt did, going among great ſinners to do them good, which indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks a great ſtrength of grace, and a Chriſt-like ſpirit, and Saints ſhould be much with <hi>God</hi> for it.</p>
                        <p>And among your ſelves, that Saints do ſtill better and not worſt one anothers Spirits, when they come together; the more you are with Saints, the more you love them, and delight in them: Have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate healing ſpirit to one anothers infirmities, and be not offended, but look upon, and love the appearance of God in each other: And remember, that receiving and doing of good is your great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs till you come to Heaven.</p>
                        <p>Yea, let all that have a new work upon them, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently find out the Company of Saints, ſuch as are viſibly joined to the Lord, and to each other, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Ordinances holily, and to help one another Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward; <hi>Woe to him that is alone,</hi> ſaith the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: Let not gracious Souls content themſelves in pollutions of worſhip, and without the company of the godly; ſuch do decay, wither, make a poor ſhift to hold out in their profeſſion, grow worldly, or are overtaken with the Errours of the times; as for the moſt part, they are the ſolitary profeſſors who are drawn aſide from Goſpel-truth, and not ſuch (as it hath been unduly charg'd) who are in the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, for that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to help, ſtrengthen, pray for, watch over each other.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Such as are New-Creatures in Chriſt, they have (if I may ſo ſpeak) <hi>new feet,</hi> namely, to <hi>walk with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:172030:121"/>
God</hi> in <hi>a new converſation: The ſteps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way,</hi> Pſal. 37.23. <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) refrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep thy word.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>New-walk</hi> of a Saint, of a New-Creature, is a large field; that I may hint the moſt material things of it,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A New-Creature doth more and more ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>walk with God;</hi> (1.) As <hi>under the eye of God,</hi> conſidering that the jealous eye of the Lord is ſtill upon him: <hi>Thou compaſſeſt my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways,</hi> Pſal. 133.3. (2.) To <hi>keep Communion with God;</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God, ſpeaking with God, and unto God, and waiting to hear God ſpeak unto him. (3.) <hi>To walk in Jeſus Chriſt. As ye have received Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him,</hi> Col. 2.6. which is, to walk in the <hi>Life</hi> of Chriſt, in the <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt, in the <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt, in the <hi>Strength</hi> of Chriſt, in the <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> of Chriſt, and ſo in all: This 'tis to have fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, and to walk in him; to do all in Chriſt, and through Chriſt, is the main work of the New-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as 'twas hinted in diſcovering the neceſſity of the New-Creature's being in Chriſt. (4.) The Walk of the New-Creature is <hi>to walk in the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.25. <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us alſo walk in the Spirit. There's no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1. To walk in the Spirit, is, (1.) Not <hi>to fulfill the Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.16. Not to be under the power of them, or to make proviſion for them; not to feed them, but to <hi>crucifie</hi> them; <hi>They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.14. which is put
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:172030:121"/>
as an evidence of walking after the Spirit. (2.) 'Tis to be <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.18. to give up our ſelves to the <hi>leadings</hi> and teachings of the Spirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God, thy ſpirit is good; lead me into the land of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> is the cry of every true Convert in Chriſt; who would not be led by his own Spirit in any thing, nor by any other mens ſpirits, but waits for the Leading of the ſpirit in every work and way, wherein he would walk before God.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The New-Creature <hi>walks after the revealed will of God: And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be upon them,</hi> Gal. 5.16. ſpeaking of the New-Creature, who walks after a rule: <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 119.1. He ſets himſelf to walk in <hi>all</hi> the precepts of God, and eſteemed them all holy and righteous.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The New-Creature <hi>walks in his integrity: Let integrity and uprightneſs preſerve me,</hi> Pſal. 25.21. <hi>As for me, I will walk in mine integrity,</hi> Pſal. 26.11. <hi>And as for me, thou upholdeſt me in mine integrity, and ſetteſt me before thy face for ever,</hi> Pſal. 41.12. This is the gracious reſolution of every Convert, to walk in his integrity, through which God will preſerve and uphold him in all his ways, and when the World reproacheth him, God will ſet him before his face, and that for ever.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The New-Creature, ſo far as he is a New-Creature, <hi>walks humbly: This is that the Lord doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thee, walk humbly with thy God,</hi> Micah 6.8. To walk humbly before the Lord, toward ſinners, and towards Saints: The ſoul that walks moſt with God, walks moſt humbly towards men.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The New-Creature <hi>walks in love; And walk in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:172030:122"/>
love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. In <hi>love</hi> to all Saints, as Saints, a ſpecial part of the Goſpel-walk: Not in love to ſuch or ſuch a party of Saints, which is but ſelf-love, but in love to all that walk with God.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. More Particulars might I mention, as <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honeſtly</hi> towards all men, not oppreſſing, defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but <hi>righteouſly, charitably, compaſſionately:</hi> So far, I ſay, as he is a New-Creature, he walks thus: Only let me add this, that the New-Creature <hi>walks by Faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. <hi>and not by ſight:</hi> He is ever learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a life of dependency, lives upon the All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of God, the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Grace, the word of his Promiſe, and ſo lives out of himſelf, upon the fulneſs of God in Chriſt, and his truth in his Promiſe, even when he feels not his preſence. And herein briefly conſiſts the Life of Faith, to live out of our ſelves, upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, even the fulneſs of an infinite God, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>In a word, The New-Creature in Chriſt, as he is called of God, through infinite Free-Grace: So is he to walk in all things, <hi>Worthy of his vocation,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 4.1. To walk worthy of the Lord, even to <hi>walk</hi> as Jeſus Chriſt <hi>himſelf walked,</hi> 1 John 2.6. To walk in this preſent world, how he might expreſs the vertues of Chriſt, the Grace and Love of Jeſus Chriſt ſo freely revealed to him, to walk ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, holily, patiently, harmleſly, profitably, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as one that is called from Darkneſs to Light, from the power of Satan to God, called out of the world, <hi>to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.14.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If this be the Walk of the New-Creature,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:172030:122"/>
then ſuch who walk not as in the Eye of God, but after the Atheiſm of their Hearts, conſider not, that God ſees them in their moſt hidden ways, that walk after their luſts to fulfil them; that walk not in the Spirit, that mind not Holineſs, ſo they keep a kind of Conſcience to men: Verily, the Spirit of God dwelleth not in you, you have no Evidence for Heaven as yet; you are of the World, and you walk after the courſe of <hi>the World,</hi> Eph. 2.2. You walk Hell-ward, and are held by the Cords of your Luſts, and your Paths lead unto deſtruction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turn in to Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Paths are Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Safety, and lead in the way of Life, and Peace, and Bleſſedneſs, even all that chooſe them, and delight in them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Let ſuch as have the New-Creature formed in them, approve themſelves to God, to Saints, and to the World, in this their <hi>New-Walk:</hi> Oh ſee! you are called to walk with God; and therefore be as in his Eye continually; make Communion with him your chiefeſt joy. Walk in Jeſus Chriſt, in his Life, Light, Power, Love, Wiſdom, and fetch your daily ſupplies from him: Walk in the Spirit, after the Spirit, as much as may be; and ſee that you keep cloſe to Rule, to the revealed Will of God, and not to Deluſions; be able to appeal to God, <hi>Judge me, Oh God, according to mine integrity,</hi> Pſal. 26.1. that you may have this Peace and Comfort in all your ways; <hi>Thou upholdeſt me, Oh Lord, in mine Integrity.</hi> And ſee you walk <hi>humbly</hi> before God and Men, and in love to all that profeſs love to Chriſt; and they do, in ſome meaſure <hi>really</hi> expreſs it, and carry it juſtly and compaſſionately towards all men.</p>
                        <p>Learn above all, the Experience of the Life of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:172030:123"/>
Faith; live not in, or upon what you have received, but live out of it, upon the Fulneſs of the Lord, as if you had received nothing. Oh ply the Throne of Grace, that you may be filled with the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and to walk in this preſent World, as near as may be, after the Holineſs, Patience, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Wiſdom, and Love of Jeſus Chriſt, which he ſhewed towards all men, having your hearts and Converſations in Heaven, where your treaſure is.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. The New-Creature doth in all things labour its own perfection, and is therefore ſtill in conflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, deſtroying, crucifying, purging out the old Creature, the old man, all of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> till it ſits down in Victory, in a full perfection of Holineſs and Glory, which it ſhall have (and not till then) at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22. — <hi>That ye put off concerning the former Converſation, the Old Man, which is corrupt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deceitful Luſts, and be renewed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Knowing this, that our Old Man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed,</hi> Rom. 6.6.</p>
                        <p>This is the main Work of the New-Creature, where it is really formed in Chriſt, to deſtroy and purge out the Defilements and Dregs of the Old Man, of Sin, Self, Corruption, that it may be as a <hi>new Lump,</hi> as a Veſſel made meet for the Lord's uſe, as <hi>formed up, ſet apart, anointed, ſanctified</hi> for God, and his uſe, here and for ever, <hi>AMEN.</hi>
